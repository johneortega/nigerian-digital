00:01:15,248 --> 00:01:16,480
What is it going to take

3
00:01:16,482 --> 00:01:18,814
to make you heed
the warnings of this court?

4
00:01:20,181 --> 00:01:21,812
It is obvious to me

5
00:01:21,814 --> 00:01:24,216
that you are not
taking this matter seriously.

6
00:01:26,282 --> 00:01:29,346
I will not allow you to continue
to harass these people.

7
00:01:29,348 --> 00:01:30,715
Is that clear?

8
00:01:32,348 --> 00:01:36,213
If you violate this restraining
order, I assure you,

9
00:01:36,215 --> 00:01:39,715
you will spend 40 days
in the county jail.

10
00:01:40,381 --> 00:01:41,913
I mean it.

11
00:01:41,915 --> 00:01:43,382
One more offense.

12
00:01:46,848 --> 00:01:48,446
What is obvious
to this court

13
00:01:48,448 --> 00:01:51,080
is that you're in need
of professional help

14
00:01:51,082 --> 00:01:54,813
and anger management
counseling.

15
00:01:54,815 --> 00:01:57,778
This court has suggested
that you seek counseling,

16
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,978
but since you can't
or won't do it voluntarily,

17
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:04,382
I am requiring it as part
of your staying out of jail.

18
00:02:05,247 --> 00:02:06,949
Do I make myself clear?

19
00:02:09,481 --> 00:02:12,447
Do I make myself clear?

20
00:02:12,449 --> 00:02:13,782
Melinda?

21
00:02:15,114 --> 00:02:16,812
Yes, Your Honor.

22
00:02:35,382 --> 00:02:37,412
So,

23
00:02:37,414 --> 00:02:41,079
do you think you have
an anger problem?

24
00:02:41,081 --> 00:02:43,948
Motherfucking right,
I got an anger problem.

25
00:02:46,047 --> 00:02:49,848
Do you feel that you're
entitled to this anger?

26
00:02:53,848 --> 00:02:58,016
That's like asking me if I'm
entitled to being hungry.

27
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:03,048
He caused all of this.

28
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,878
All of it.

29
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,345
It's not me.
That son of a bitch owes me.

30
00:03:07,347 --> 00:03:09,013
What do you think
he owes you?

31
00:03:09,015 --> 00:03:11,383
Every damn breath
in his body.

32
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,382
Why do you feel
that way?

33
00:03:22,147 --> 00:03:24,015
You don't know
what he did to me.

34
00:03:24,981 --> 00:03:26,349
You don't know.

35
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:30,345
Would you like to
share what he did?

36
00:03:30,347 --> 00:03:32,778
Do I have a choice?

37
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,282
We all have choices.

38
00:03:35,914 --> 00:03:39,215
Not when some damn judge
is making me sit here.

39
00:03:41,348 --> 00:03:45,149
You know what? This is bullshit, okay?

40
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:55,181
This motherfucker torments me, and
he gets to walk away free.

41
00:04:01,815 --> 00:04:03,312
What are you writing?

42
00:04:03,314 --> 00:04:04,681
Just my notes.

43
00:04:05,948 --> 00:04:07,649
And what do your notes say?

44
00:04:10,115 --> 00:04:11,782
I'm a stereotype?

45
00:04:13,181 --> 00:04:15,016
Is that what you
think you are?

46
00:04:15,347 --> 00:04:16,815
Hell, no!

47
00:04:19,714 --> 00:04:21,881
Sick and tired
of hearing that.

48
00:04:23,414 --> 00:04:27,411
Every time a black woman gets
mad, she's a stereotype.

49
00:04:27,413 --> 00:04:29,781
Ooh, she emasculates men.

50
00:04:30,748 --> 00:04:32,478
Is that what you
think you did?

51
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,280
Bitch,

52
00:04:34,282 --> 00:04:36,181
are you not
listening to me?

53
00:04:37,948 --> 00:04:40,949
I never did
anything to him.

54
00:04:44,915 --> 00:04:47,315
I was everything
he needed me to be.

55
00:04:49,715 --> 00:04:50,849
I was...

56
00:04:52,748 --> 00:04:55,945
I was strong
when he needed me to be.

57
00:04:55,947 --> 00:04:59,182
I played weak
when he needed me to.

58
00:05:00,848 --> 00:05:02,315
I was pathetic.

59
00:05:06,847 --> 00:05:07,914
I was...

60
00:05:16,381 --> 00:05:19,081
Don't tell me I don't have
a right to be angry? Hmm?

61
00:05:20,115 --> 00:05:22,116
Is that what you
think I said?

62
00:05:23,347 --> 00:05:25,411
I really don't give
a damn what you said.

63
00:05:25,413 --> 00:05:26,813
But this is wrong.

64
00:05:26,815 --> 00:05:28,446
All of this is wrong.

65
00:05:28,448 --> 00:05:31,045
Why don't we
do this?

66
00:05:31,047 --> 00:05:34,745
Why don't we just start
from the beginning?

67
00:05:34,747 --> 00:05:36,813
Help me understand
this injustice.

68
00:05:36,815 --> 00:05:38,414
Just tell me
what happened.

69
00:05:44,881 --> 00:05:46,749
How far back
do you wanna go?

70
00:05:49,747 --> 00:05:51,848
I remember every damn day.

71
00:05:53,781 --> 00:05:55,016
That's the problem.

72
00:05:56,048 --> 00:05:57,479
Can't forget it.

73
00:05:57,481 --> 00:06:00,348
I can't get it
out of my head.

74
00:06:02,114 --> 00:06:03,648
So...

75
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,347
How far do you wanna go?

76
00:06:08,413 --> 00:06:10,914
Well, let's start
at the beginning.

77
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:13,478
Okay.

78
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,112
How'd you meet him?

79
00:06:15,114 --> 00:06:16,881
It was raining.

80
00:06:19,215 --> 00:06:21,016
<i>I was in college,</i>

81
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,445
<i>and I was studying late.</i>

82
00:06:24,447 --> 00:06:27,112
<i>It was raining really hard.</i>

83
00:06:27,114 --> 00:06:30,879
<i>I don't know what crazy shit
happens to me in the rain.</i>

84
00:06:30,881 --> 00:06:33,446
<i>Around water.</i>

85
00:06:33,448 --> 00:06:37,778
<i>I was trying to get back to
my dorm, and I ran into him.</i>

86
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,312
- No!
- Damn!

87
00:06:39,314 --> 00:06:41,279
- No, no!
- You can't watch what you're doing?

88
00:06:41,281 --> 00:06:43,082
Move! You the idiot
who bumped into me!

89
00:06:45,246 --> 00:06:46,781
Girl, what's
wrong with you?

90
00:06:49,413 --> 00:06:51,013
Damn!

91
00:06:58,214 --> 00:06:59,312
Hi.

92
00:06:59,314 --> 00:07:00,981
Is Melissa here?

93
00:07:01,948 --> 00:07:03,415
There's no Melissa here.

94
00:07:04,313 --> 00:07:06,113
Oh, Melinda.
Melinda's...

95
00:07:06,115 --> 00:07:07,279
What do you want?

96
00:07:07,281 --> 00:07:09,049
- Who's this?
- The asshole.

97
00:07:09,914 --> 00:07:11,713
I'm sorry. Here.

98
00:07:11,715 --> 00:07:13,013
I have some
of your papers.

99
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:16,179
Great. Just great.

100
00:07:16,181 --> 00:07:18,113
And I think you may have
one or two of mine.

101
00:07:18,115 --> 00:07:21,113
No, I don't. Sorry.

102
00:07:21,115 --> 00:07:24,279
Here. Forgive her. She's really
bad at history, and she had

103
00:07:24,281 --> 00:07:25,649
- a paper to turn in today.
- Sarah!

104
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,579
Goodbye.

105
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:31,045
Look, I feel really bad
about bumping into you.

106
00:07:31,047 --> 00:07:33,681
I can be in my own head when
I'm working on a project.

107
00:07:34,214 --> 00:07:35,278
I'm sorry.

108
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,479
Okay, yeah. Fine.

109
00:07:36,481 --> 00:07:38,212
But if you don't
mind now,

110
00:07:38,214 --> 00:07:40,379
I have less than 24 hours
to finish my paper.

111
00:07:40,381 --> 00:07:41,512
So, goodbye.

112
00:07:41,514 --> 00:07:44,745
Well, your basis is way off
in the first four pages,

113
00:07:44,747 --> 00:07:47,244
and the facts of the Spanish
American War are wrong.

114
00:07:47,246 --> 00:07:49,415
And Professor Huff will
catch that in a second.

115
00:07:50,448 --> 00:07:51,878
How do you
know that?

116
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,080
I took his class
last year.

117
00:07:54,082 --> 00:07:55,981
I'm sorry for reading
your first pages.

118
00:07:57,313 --> 00:07:59,845
I got an A
in his class.

119
00:07:59,847 --> 00:08:01,682
I can help you
if you'd like.

120
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:06,012
<i>I was so
mad the first time I saw him</i>

121
00:08:06,014 --> 00:08:09,112
<i>that I didn't even realize
how handsome he was.</i>

122
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:10,212
Please?

123
00:08:10,214 --> 00:08:12,479
<i>He was beautiful.
Gotta give him that.</i>

124
00:08:12,481 --> 00:08:16,012
<i>The devil sure knows
how to put a package together.</i>

125
00:08:16,014 --> 00:08:20,144
<i>Standing in front of me
was all the things I loved.</i>

126
00:08:20,146 --> 00:08:23,345
<i>He was dark, sexy.</i>

127
00:08:23,347 --> 00:08:25,312
- It was 1497.
- No!

128
00:08:25,314 --> 00:08:27,378
Look, this is too
hard for me to remember.

129
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,413
Can we take a break?

130
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:30,478
I don't wanna talk
about this stuff anymore.

131
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,813
You don't have
much time.

132
00:08:31,815 --> 00:08:33,946
It's too much, okay?

133
00:08:33,948 --> 00:08:37,111
I'm on a brain overload.

134
00:08:37,113 --> 00:08:40,145
So, let's talk
about you.

135
00:08:40,147 --> 00:08:43,745
Those papers you needed,
what were they?

136
00:08:43,747 --> 00:08:44,845
Tell me.

137
00:08:44,847 --> 00:08:47,879
I think I've found a solution
to an age-old problem.

138
00:08:47,881 --> 00:08:50,945
I'm creating a battery
that can recharge itself.

139
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:55,279
If it works, it can be used
in cars, homes, you name it.

140
00:08:55,281 --> 00:08:57,244
And I'm gonna be so rich.

141
00:08:57,246 --> 00:08:59,112
While saving the environment,
of course.

142
00:08:59,114 --> 00:09:00,949
Of course.

143
00:09:02,113 --> 00:09:03,781
<i>He was so charming.</i>

144
00:09:04,914 --> 00:09:06,879
<i>So slick.</i>

145
00:09:06,881 --> 00:09:08,212
<i>I just wish to high heaven</i>

146
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:12,244
<i>someone would have said to me
right then and there,</i>

147
00:09:12,246 --> 00:09:14,913
<i>"Girl, get up and run as fast
as you can</i>

148
00:09:14,915 --> 00:09:18,813
<i>"because this man
will leave you devastated."</i>

149
00:09:18,815 --> 00:09:20,245
How'd you do?

150
00:09:20,247 --> 00:09:21,280
Tell me.

151
00:09:23,815 --> 00:09:25,078
But we studied.

152
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,379
Yo, I'm sorry.

153
00:09:26,381 --> 00:09:28,012
Let me talk to Professor Huff.
Maybe we get you a make-up.

154
00:09:28,014 --> 00:09:29,178
No. No, okay?

155
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:33,145
I mean, this is all
just a waste of money.

156
00:09:33,147 --> 00:09:35,247
I can't keep
doing this to my mother.

157
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,746
To be honest
with you, I mean,

158
00:09:37,748 --> 00:09:40,845
she was surprised
I was even going to school.

159
00:09:40,847 --> 00:09:42,948
I wasn't as smart
as my sisters.

160
00:09:44,448 --> 00:09:45,782
Come here.

161
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:51,115
Melinda.

162
00:09:53,314 --> 00:09:55,979
Hey, what are you
doing here?

163
00:09:55,981 --> 00:09:57,511
Mama.

164
00:09:57,513 --> 00:10:01,079
<i>My sisters came to tell
me that my mother had died.</i>

165
00:10:02,815 --> 00:10:05,412
<i>My mother and I
always been close.</i>

166
00:10:05,414 --> 00:10:08,879
May she rest
in peace. Amen.

167
00:10:08,881 --> 00:10:10,344
<i>I was numb.</i>

168
00:10:10,346 --> 00:10:12,915
<i>I was so desperate
to feel anything.</i>

169
00:10:13,981 --> 00:10:15,479
<i>You see,
that's how this happened.</i>

170
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:19,048
<i>He was there at the right time
to take advantage of me.</i>

171
00:10:28,714 --> 00:10:29,778
Hi.

172
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:30,945
I'm Brenda.

173
00:10:30,947 --> 00:10:32,779
Hey, I'm Robert.

174
00:10:32,781 --> 00:10:34,378
You have a last name?

175
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:35,746
Gayle.

176
00:10:35,748 --> 00:10:37,180
- Hmm.
- How do you know Melinda?

177
00:10:38,481 --> 00:10:40,746
- School.
- Oh.

178
00:10:40,748 --> 00:10:42,779
Well, we haven't seen
you around here.

179
00:10:42,781 --> 00:10:44,977
Yeah, I'm from Kirkwood.

180
00:10:44,979 --> 00:10:46,178
Oh.

181
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:49,411
Well, this is a different
side of the tracks for you.

182
00:10:49,413 --> 00:10:51,478
What do you do
for a living?

183
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,211
I'm in school right now.

184
00:10:53,213 --> 00:10:55,179
Oh. That's good.
That's good.

185
00:10:55,181 --> 00:10:57,745
Yeah.

186
00:10:57,747 --> 00:11:00,080
Well, if you don't have a job,
then who's paying for it?

187
00:11:01,481 --> 00:11:04,011
Student loans.
Scholarships.

188
00:11:04,013 --> 00:11:05,145
That kind of thing.

189
00:11:05,147 --> 00:11:06,279
Oh. So you must
be smart.

190
00:11:06,281 --> 00:11:07,879
Or an athlete.

191
00:11:07,881 --> 00:11:09,414
- No, no athlete.
- No? Oh.

192
00:11:11,381 --> 00:11:13,813
Oh. This is
my boyfriend, Casey.

193
00:11:13,815 --> 00:11:15,478
Oh. Hi. Hi, man.

194
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,978
- Hey. Nice to meet you, man.
- Good to meet you, too.

195
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,813
And this is Kalvin,
Brenda's fiance.

196
00:11:18,815 --> 00:11:20,011
- What's up, man?
- Good to meet you.

197
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:21,211
Good to meet
you as well.

198
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:22,912
So what are
you studying?

199
00:11:22,914 --> 00:11:24,411
Mechanical engineering.

200
00:11:24,413 --> 00:11:26,347
- Oh. Devon, come here.
- Hey.

201
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:27,911
Hey.

202
00:11:27,913 --> 00:11:29,078
Sorry about your mom.

203
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,144
Thank you so much.

204
00:11:30,146 --> 00:11:32,145
- How are you?
- I'm good.

205
00:11:32,147 --> 00:11:33,911
Oh. I'm so rude.
Um...

206
00:11:33,913 --> 00:11:35,479
What's your
name again?

207
00:11:35,481 --> 00:11:36,812
Robert.

208
00:11:36,814 --> 00:11:38,378
Robert. Robert,
this is Devon.

209
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,144
Devon, this
is Robert.

210
00:11:40,146 --> 00:11:42,648
- Devon is Melinda's boyfriend.
- Nice to meet you.

211
00:11:43,346 --> 00:11:44,412
Ex-boyfriend.

212
00:11:44,414 --> 00:11:46,978
- You know she still loves you.
- Mmm-hmm.

213
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,914
Oh, Mel,
look who came!

214
00:11:49,815 --> 00:11:51,278
Hey.

215
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,977
I'm sorry about
your mom.

216
00:11:52,979 --> 00:11:54,345
Thank you.

217
00:11:54,347 --> 00:11:57,079
Oh, uh, Devon, come
with me for a second.

218
00:11:57,081 --> 00:11:59,011
Melinda, we have
to thank the pastor.

219
00:11:59,013 --> 00:12:01,045
- You know him, right? Okay.
- Yeah, yeah.

220
00:12:01,047 --> 00:12:02,981
- I'll be right back, okay?
- Okay.

221
00:12:18,848 --> 00:12:20,211
Robert!

222
00:12:20,213 --> 00:12:21,648
- Hey.
- Hey.

223
00:12:22,748 --> 00:12:25,012
Why are you
leaving so soon?

224
00:12:25,014 --> 00:12:26,378
Well, you have
your family.

225
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,947
I just wanted to make
sure that you're okay.

226
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:32,111
Thank you.

227
00:12:32,113 --> 00:12:33,114
Yeah.

228
00:12:34,447 --> 00:12:35,648
Of course.

229
00:12:39,081 --> 00:12:40,844
I'll see you later,
all right?

230
00:12:40,846 --> 00:12:42,681
Wait, where are
you going?

231
00:12:44,313 --> 00:12:45,347
To the train.

232
00:12:46,714 --> 00:12:48,844
The train? I mean,
that's a long way.

233
00:12:48,846 --> 00:12:50,112
Did you walk here?

234
00:12:50,114 --> 00:12:51,779
You walked here?
Look, no, I can just...

235
00:12:51,781 --> 00:12:53,045
- No, I'm fine. I'm fine.
- I can drive you.

236
00:12:53,047 --> 00:12:53,911
No, no, look.
I'll get my keys.

237
00:12:53,913 --> 00:12:55,944
I'll be right back,
I'll drive you.

238
00:12:55,946 --> 00:12:57,147
Mel. Melin...

239
00:13:03,114 --> 00:13:04,881
Wow,
is that your house?

240
00:13:06,213 --> 00:13:08,148
No.
That's my house.

241
00:13:10,947 --> 00:13:12,248
You live in there?

242
00:13:12,747 --> 00:13:13,748
Yeah.

243
00:13:15,147 --> 00:13:16,681
Can I come in?

244
00:13:18,081 --> 00:13:19,215
Yeah.

245
00:13:25,979 --> 00:13:27,045
Watch your step.

246
00:13:27,047 --> 00:13:28,047
Thank you.

247
00:13:39,113 --> 00:13:40,880
What kind
of music is this?

248
00:13:42,246 --> 00:13:44,145
Are you kidding me?

249
00:13:44,147 --> 00:13:45,312
What?

250
00:13:45,314 --> 00:13:46,781
This is Nina Simone.

251
00:13:47,748 --> 00:13:49,115
You've never
heard of her?

252
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,244
No.

253
00:13:51,246 --> 00:13:53,344
I need to play something
for you then. Hold on.

254
00:13:53,346 --> 00:13:55,144
- I'll pass.
- No, no, no.

255
00:13:55,146 --> 00:13:56,445
You have to
hear her voice.

256
00:13:56,447 --> 00:13:58,281
Her singing is like
going to church.

257
00:13:59,947 --> 00:14:01,278
Listen.

258
00:14:06,813 --> 00:14:08,247
It's kind of sad.

259
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:09,979
I'm so sorry.

260
00:14:09,981 --> 00:14:12,147
No, no, no. It's fine.
You can leave it on.

261
00:14:17,847 --> 00:14:20,081
So how long have
you lived here?

262
00:14:21,013 --> 00:14:23,245
A while.

263
00:14:23,247 --> 00:14:26,713
I know it's not much, but
my uncle left it to me,

264
00:14:26,715 --> 00:14:29,682
and my aunt lets me stay here
in the driveway for free.

265
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:32,848
Where are your parents?

266
00:14:33,746 --> 00:14:35,713
My father's in prison.

267
00:14:35,715 --> 00:14:37,312
And my mother left me
with my grandmother,

268
00:14:37,314 --> 00:14:40,115
who raised me until she died
when I was 14.

269
00:14:42,247 --> 00:14:44,744
Then I moved
out here with my aunt,

270
00:14:44,746 --> 00:14:46,647
and I've been living
out here ever since.

271
00:14:50,714 --> 00:14:53,244
I'm sorry to hear
about your mother.

272
00:14:53,246 --> 00:14:54,977
She sounded like
a good lady.

273
00:14:54,979 --> 00:14:56,245
Yeah.

274
00:14:56,247 --> 00:14:59,781
Yeah, she was amazing.

275
00:15:00,447 --> 00:15:02,280
You know, she...

276
00:15:03,714 --> 00:15:04,814
It's okay.

277
00:15:05,914 --> 00:15:07,281
Come here.

278
00:15:11,113 --> 00:15:12,744
I'm sorry.

279
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:14,079
<i>There was something about</i>

280
00:15:14,081 --> 00:15:16,479
<i>the way he said he was sorry
that made me believe it.</i>

281
00:15:16,481 --> 00:15:18,745
<i>And the way he held me.</i>

282
00:15:18,747 --> 00:15:21,078
<i>I know this sounds so stupid,</i>

283
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,812
<i>but you have to know,
I was a kid.</i>

284
00:15:23,814 --> 00:15:27,378
<i>He made me feel safe
and strong, and...</i>

285
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,777
You're beautiful.

286
00:15:28,779 --> 00:15:30,245
<i>Beautiful.</i>

287
00:15:30,247 --> 00:15:33,112
<i>My mother wasn't even
cold in the ground yet,</i>

288
00:15:33,114 --> 00:15:36,079
<i>and there I was.</i>

289
00:15:36,081 --> 00:15:39,312
<i>What kind of man takes advantage
of a girl's grief, huh?</i>

290
00:15:39,314 --> 00:15:40,778
<i>I'll tell you.</i>

291
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:44,279
<i>A low-life maggot of a
motherfucker, that's who.</i>

292
00:15:44,281 --> 00:15:47,777
<i>He had to know that grief
can leave you open</i>

293
00:15:47,779 --> 00:15:50,111
<i>to not knowing yourself at all.</i>

294
00:15:50,113 --> 00:15:53,145
<i>Add that to me being so young.</i>

295
00:15:53,147 --> 00:15:57,112
<i>He had my mind,
my heart, my head</i>

296
00:15:57,114 --> 00:15:59,044
<i>and, let's not forget,</i>

297
00:15:59,046 --> 00:16:00,844
<i>my virginity.</i>

298
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,278
Oh. What are you
listening to in here?

299
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,445
You never heard
of Nina Simone?

300
00:16:27,447 --> 00:16:29,211
Oh. That's
Mama's music.

301
00:16:29,213 --> 00:16:30,813
Or it's that boy's.

302
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,648
You going out
with him again?

303
00:16:36,447 --> 00:16:37,745
Yeah.

304
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:40,844
And I wish
you would stop saying "him."

305
00:16:40,846 --> 00:16:44,944
His name is Robert,
and I really like him, okay?

306
00:16:44,946 --> 00:16:46,944
And I want you
to like him, too.

307
00:16:46,946 --> 00:16:49,214
Are you having
sex with him?

308
00:16:51,979 --> 00:16:53,777
Well, it's
a fair question.

309
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:55,944
But what I wanna
know is,

310
00:16:55,946 --> 00:16:58,980
who's paying when y'all going
out on all these dates?

311
00:17:00,346 --> 00:17:01,347
What?

312
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:03,280
Look, Melinda.

313
00:17:04,181 --> 00:17:05,246
Don't tell that boy

314
00:17:05,248 --> 00:17:07,712
that Mama left you that
money and this house.

315
00:17:07,714 --> 00:17:09,014
- I'm telling you.
- All right.

316
00:17:13,146 --> 00:17:16,777
<i>Ugh. I hate to admit</i>
it, but Brenda was right.

317
00:17:18,347 --> 00:17:21,179
<i>I had made the mistake of
telling Robert about the house</i>

318
00:17:21,181 --> 00:17:25,178
<i>and the $350,000
that my mom left me.</i>

319
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:27,845
<i>But that didn't
matter to him, right?</i>

320
00:17:27,847 --> 00:17:29,744
<i>He wanted me.</i>

321
00:17:29,746 --> 00:17:31,078
<i>Right?</i>

322
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,411
So the name of the company is called
Prescott and Howard Industries.

323
00:17:33,413 --> 00:17:34,578
Okay.

324
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:38,212
And the owner, David Prescott,
is a super cool guy.

325
00:17:38,214 --> 00:17:42,312
Man, he's always looking
for the next big thing.

326
00:17:42,314 --> 00:17:44,079
And he's a tree-hugger
billionaire

327
00:17:44,081 --> 00:17:46,079
always talking about saving
the environment, you know?

328
00:17:46,081 --> 00:17:48,279
So he finds people
who just have great ideas

329
00:17:48,281 --> 00:17:52,211
and he changes
their lives.

330
00:17:52,213 --> 00:17:54,777
You know, he's made millionaires
out of a lot of people

331
00:17:54,779 --> 00:17:56,414
just by investing
in their project.

332
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,479
And it's a lottery.

333
00:17:58,481 --> 00:18:01,479
He goes through
the mail and finds ideas.

334
00:18:01,481 --> 00:18:04,278
But if he likes them, then he
contacts you for a meeting,

335
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:07,877
and you have to come
right when he says come,

336
00:18:07,879 --> 00:18:09,912
which is pretty cool.

337
00:18:09,914 --> 00:18:11,878
So I send a letter
to his office every week

338
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,012
talking about
my battery idea.

339
00:18:14,014 --> 00:18:15,314
You know
what I call it?

340
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,711
The Gayle Wind.

341
00:18:19,713 --> 00:18:21,315
You know,
my last name.

342
00:18:21,979 --> 00:18:23,044
Okay, but, look.

343
00:18:23,046 --> 00:18:25,877
So is the battery,
like, that powerful?

344
00:18:25,879 --> 00:18:27,145
Yeah.

345
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:31,248
Yeah, well, I think you should
call it Gayle Force Wind.

346
00:18:32,247 --> 00:18:34,044
- Oh, man!
- Yeah?

347
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:35,412
- I like that better.
- Yeah.

348
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:37,178
I love that.

349
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:39,312
I need to
write it down.

350
00:18:39,314 --> 00:18:41,181
I'll be around
to remind you.

351
00:18:42,947 --> 00:18:44,215
You promise?

352
00:18:45,414 --> 00:18:47,478
What, you planned
on kickin' me out?

353
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,211
No.

354
00:18:49,213 --> 00:18:52,079
Just a lot of
disappointments, that's all.

355
00:18:52,081 --> 00:18:54,382
Mmm. I won't
disappoint you.

356
00:19:02,081 --> 00:19:03,415
And I won't
disappoint you.

357
00:19:06,013 --> 00:19:08,011
We're gonna be so rich.

358
00:19:08,013 --> 00:19:09,145
Look, The Gayle
Force Wind

359
00:19:09,147 --> 00:19:11,278
is gonna allow us to live
in that building right there,

360
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,778
on the top floor.

361
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:15,111
And we're gonna have
one of those.

362
00:19:15,113 --> 00:19:17,211
What? A tugboat?

363
00:19:17,213 --> 00:19:18,379
No, a yacht.

364
00:19:18,381 --> 00:19:20,344
And I will name it
<i>The Mrs. Gayle.</i>

365
00:19:20,346 --> 00:19:22,044
<i>The Mrs. Gayle?</i>

366
00:19:22,046 --> 00:19:25,412
Yeah, I'm gonna name it after
you when we get married.

367
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:28,748
You're gonna be
my wife forever.

368
00:19:30,081 --> 00:19:33,345
<i>"Forever."
That's what he said.</i>

369
00:19:33,347 --> 00:19:37,144
<i>Those were his words.
"Forever."</i>

370
00:19:37,146 --> 00:19:38,711
<i>And I believed him.</i>

371
00:19:38,713 --> 00:19:40,178
<i>I trusted him.</i>

372
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,977
<i>I was so in love with him,</i>

373
00:19:41,979 --> 00:19:45,011
<i>I didn't see
the con man for the con.</i>

374
00:19:45,013 --> 00:19:46,313
<i>Man!</i>

375
00:19:46,315 --> 00:19:49,278
We could have our first
kid before, like, the age of 28.

376
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,811
And then we can have one,
like, right after, so

377
00:19:51,813 --> 00:19:53,178
keep this body
in shape.

378
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:58,278
A little baby,
I can't wait.

379
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,977
Look, we're gonna have
all the kids we want

380
00:20:00,979 --> 00:20:02,912
because we have
all the money we want.

381
00:20:02,914 --> 00:20:06,078
- So I sent another letter to Prescott, right?
- Mmm-hmm.

382
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,180
And I was thinking, what if he calls
and I have to wait for a bus?

383
00:20:10,314 --> 00:20:13,345
I mean, I can just
drive you when he calls.

384
00:20:13,347 --> 00:20:15,048
What if you're
not around?

385
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:18,344
<i>You see the game?</i>

386
00:20:18,346 --> 00:20:21,978
<i>He had a way of not asking
but suggesting</i>

387
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:25,248
<i>to make me think
I wanted to do things for him.</i>

388
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:28,045
<i>And wouldn't you know it?</i>

389
00:20:28,047 --> 00:20:32,478
<i>A few days after he got the car,
the only time I talked to him</i>

390
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,112
<i>was when I called him.</i>

391
00:20:35,114 --> 00:20:40,111
<i>One day, I waited a whole day to see
if he would call me, and he didn't.</i>

392
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:43,478
<i>So I waited two days,
and he still didn't call me.</i>

393
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,644
<i>Melinda.</i>

394
00:20:44,646 --> 00:20:48,445
We need to tell you that now
that we're all married,

395
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:49,981
we're gonna be
moving out.

396
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,377
- Okay.
- Thank you, babe.

397
00:20:53,379 --> 00:20:57,913
So, you need to get a job so
you can keep up this place.

398
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:01,377
Yeah.

399
00:21:01,379 --> 00:21:02,747
Okay.

400
00:21:04,447 --> 00:21:05,948
I'll be right back.

401
00:21:33,013 --> 00:21:34,211
<i>Hello?</i>

402
00:21:34,213 --> 00:21:36,044
Hey.

403
00:21:36,046 --> 00:21:38,212
<i>Oh. Hey, there! How are you?</i>

404
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:39,444
<i>"Hey, there?"</i>

405
00:21:39,446 --> 00:21:41,011
<i>"How are you?"</i>

406
00:21:41,013 --> 00:21:44,812
<i>Wait. Wait. Why the hell
was he talking to me like that?</i>

407
00:21:44,814 --> 00:21:47,244
I don't know. You tell me.

408
00:21:47,246 --> 00:21:48,944
<i>Oh. Nothing, baby.</i>

409
00:21:48,946 --> 00:21:51,078
<i>I've been working
on my battery.</i>

410
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:55,445
Okay, well, you
haven't called me in two days.

411
00:21:55,447 --> 00:21:57,912
<i>Well, you didn't call me.</i>

412
00:21:57,914 --> 00:21:59,444
<i>I thought you were busy.</i>

413
00:21:59,446 --> 00:22:00,812
Doing what?

414
00:22:00,814 --> 00:22:01,879
<i>I don't know.</i>

415
00:22:01,881 --> 00:22:04,311
<i>But, baby, I need both my hands
for this soldering.</i>

416
00:22:04,313 --> 00:22:05,977
<i>Can I call you back?</i>

417
00:22:05,979 --> 00:22:07,610
<i>You ever get that feeling</i>

418
00:22:07,612 --> 00:22:12,078
<i>when a man is telling you something,
and you know it's bullshit,</i>

419
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,378
<i>but you just go with it?</i>

420
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:16,411
Yeah. Yeah.

421
00:22:16,413 --> 00:22:21,011
<i>Well, I knew this was bullshit,
and I tried to go with it.</i>

422
00:22:21,013 --> 00:22:23,277
<i>But as nice as I could be,</i>

423
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:27,310
<i>there was also another side
to me that he hadn't met yet.</i>

424
00:22:27,312 --> 00:22:29,179
<i>If he was lying to me,</i>

425
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:33,178
<i>maybe it was time for me to
introduce him to my bitch.</i>

426
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:35,246
<i>And, I mean,
she's a motherfucker.</i>

427
00:22:38,013 --> 00:22:39,711
<i>Call it women's intuition.</i>

428
00:22:39,713 --> 00:22:41,378
<i>I don't know. Call it whatever.</i>

429
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:45,044
<i>All I know is that something
made me drive over there.</i>

430
00:22:45,046 --> 00:22:48,978
<i>Not only did I drive over there, but
the same thing that made me drive</i>

431
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:53,744
<i>told me to park across the
street and not get too close.</i>

432
00:22:53,746 --> 00:22:58,344
<i>After sitting there for almost
an hour, I felt kind of stupid.</i>

433
00:22:58,346 --> 00:23:00,477
<i>I was trying to talk myself</i>

434
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:03,410
<i>out of the voice
that was deep inside myself.</i>

435
00:23:03,412 --> 00:23:05,310
<i>That was myself.</i>

436
00:23:05,312 --> 00:23:08,078
<i>I started thinking,
"How dumb is this?</i>

437
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,711
<i>"Oh, God.
This looks desperate."</i>

438
00:23:10,713 --> 00:23:13,410
<i>There I was, sitting outside
of a man's house...</i>

439
00:23:13,412 --> 00:23:14,912
<i>Well, RV,</i>

440
00:23:14,914 --> 00:23:17,877
<i>trying to see
if he's lying to me.</i>

441
00:23:17,879 --> 00:23:20,311
<i>I already knew he was lying!</i>

442
00:23:20,313 --> 00:23:22,445
<i>It was in my damn gut!</i>

443
00:23:22,447 --> 00:23:25,880
<i>And here I am trying to confirm
what I already knew.</i>

444
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,411
<i>I'm not doing this.</i>

445
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:47,180
<i>There is something
about my crazy.</i>

446
00:23:48,345 --> 00:23:49,745
<i>It's blind.</i>

447
00:23:49,747 --> 00:23:50,977
<i>It's not rational.</i>

448
00:23:50,979 --> 00:23:53,177
<i>It rages. It doesn't stop.</i>

449
00:23:53,179 --> 00:23:55,778
<i>It doesn't subside.
It doesn't quit.</i>

450
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:56,944
<i>It's immediate.</i>

451
00:24:12,413 --> 00:24:13,545
Robert, what was that?

452
00:24:13,547 --> 00:24:15,048
What the hell?
I don't know. Are you okay?

453
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,045
This what you do to me?

454
00:24:33,047 --> 00:24:34,777
Give me your hand.

455
00:24:34,779 --> 00:24:36,048
Is this what you do?

456
00:24:37,947 --> 00:24:39,211
Is this what you do to me?

457
00:24:39,213 --> 00:24:41,310
- Melinda! Melinda!
- This is what you do to me?

458
00:24:41,312 --> 00:24:43,112
And then you lying
with this bitch!

459
00:24:43,114 --> 00:24:44,210
Melinda!

460
00:24:44,212 --> 00:24:45,277
Yeah!

461
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:46,477
What you looking
at, bitch?

462
00:24:46,479 --> 00:24:48,811
You didn't tell me you were
in a relationship, Robert!

463
00:24:48,813 --> 00:24:50,278
- Go!
- What you looking at? Yeah!

464
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,444
- Stop, stop! Please!
- Don't touch me!

465
00:24:52,446 --> 00:24:54,344
- Please, what? Please, what?
- Come on, please!

466
00:24:54,346 --> 00:24:55,445
- Please!
- Please, what?

467
00:24:55,447 --> 00:24:57,012
Stop it. Stop it!

468
00:24:57,014 --> 00:24:59,343
- Let go of me!
- Stop!

469
00:24:59,345 --> 00:25:02,847
You're bleeding. We gotta
stop the bleeding.

470
00:25:03,379 --> 00:25:04,947
Christ. Melinda.

471
00:25:05,947 --> 00:25:07,814
Melinda! Melinda!

472
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:09,680
Fuck!

473
00:25:11,113 --> 00:25:13,911
<i>I had so much
adrenalin that I didn't know</i>

474
00:25:13,913 --> 00:25:17,279
<i>I slammed my body against
the steering wheel so hard.</i>

475
00:25:18,746 --> 00:25:20,144
<i>Internal bleeding.</i>

476
00:25:20,146 --> 00:25:23,812
<i>And worse, ruptured ovaries.</i>

477
00:25:23,814 --> 00:25:28,012
<i>A full hysterectomy,
and I wasn't even 21 years old.</i>

478
00:25:28,014 --> 00:25:30,414
<i>Children, never.</i>

479
00:25:35,145 --> 00:25:38,278
No. No, no.

480
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:41,444
So you cheat on her,
you take her money,

481
00:25:41,446 --> 00:25:44,911
she buys you a car,
and you do that?

482
00:25:44,913 --> 00:25:46,343
You do that?

483
00:25:46,345 --> 00:25:48,144
She better be all right.

484
00:25:48,146 --> 00:25:50,111
That's all I know,
you know?

485
00:25:50,113 --> 00:25:51,777
- Hey, hey...
- Just get out!

486
00:25:51,779 --> 00:25:53,477
Get out of here!

487
00:25:53,479 --> 00:25:55,381
- Get out of here!
- Maybe it's best you leave.

488
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:58,912
You're not
welcome here!

489
00:25:58,914 --> 00:26:00,247
- Get out!
- Go.

490
00:26:04,313 --> 00:26:05,714
I'll call you.

491
00:26:06,312 --> 00:26:07,877
I'll call you.

492
00:26:07,879 --> 00:26:09,778
How could he do
this to her?

493
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:11,878
How could he do
that to her?

494
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,214
<i>I was laid up
for three weeks.</i>

495
00:26:15,045 --> 00:26:17,912
<i>I was in so much pain.</i>

496
00:26:17,914 --> 00:26:19,044
Melinda, you've been
doing this

497
00:26:19,046 --> 00:26:20,844
- since you were a little girl.
- Yes.

498
00:26:20,846 --> 00:26:22,745
You get mad
and nothing matters.

499
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:24,714
You have to stop
doing that.

500
00:26:25,112 --> 00:26:26,211
I know.

501
00:26:26,213 --> 00:26:28,010
<i>I did know that.</i>

502
00:26:28,012 --> 00:26:30,344
<i>For some reason,
I couldn't control it,</i>

503
00:26:30,346 --> 00:26:33,878
<i>any more than I could control
how I was feeling about him.</i>

504
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:37,877
<i>I soon realized that most of my
pain wasn't physical. It was...</i>

505
00:26:37,879 --> 00:26:38,880
Melinda!

506
00:26:40,713 --> 00:26:42,445
No, no, no. Look,

507
00:26:42,447 --> 00:26:44,477
you have to let him
talk to me.

508
00:26:44,479 --> 00:26:47,010
Please? I just want
to know why.

509
00:26:47,012 --> 00:26:49,178
Baby, sometimes
men don't have a why.

510
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:51,277
No. They just got
a bunch of lies.

511
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:53,980
June, can you go get him for me?
Please?

512
00:26:56,946 --> 00:26:59,977
He ain't coming in here
to do nothing but lie to you.

513
00:26:59,979 --> 00:27:02,410
He probably just broke and hungry
and needs some more money.

514
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:03,744
Why don't you just

515
00:27:03,746 --> 00:27:06,747
let him get it from the whore
you just caught him with, huh?

516
00:27:12,846 --> 00:27:15,080
Can we have a moment, please?

517
00:27:16,946 --> 00:27:18,077
Please?

518
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:20,745
We will be right on the
other side of this door.

519
00:27:20,747 --> 00:27:22,381
Okay. All right.

520
00:27:23,746 --> 00:27:24,747
Come on.

521
00:27:35,413 --> 00:27:36,914
I'm so sorry, baby.

522
00:27:37,945 --> 00:27:39,745
I don't even know
why I was with her.

523
00:27:39,747 --> 00:27:41,744
She didn't mean
nothing to me.

524
00:27:41,746 --> 00:27:42,880
Nothing.

525
00:27:44,914 --> 00:27:46,278
It was just sex.

526
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,977
<i>And here we go.</i>

527
00:27:47,979 --> 00:27:51,311
<i>How many times has a woman
heard this bullshit?</i>

528
00:27:51,313 --> 00:27:55,146
And I felt so bad because
you been there for me.

529
00:27:58,212 --> 00:28:00,647
I love you. Just you.

530
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,380
I'm sick without you.

531
00:28:04,714 --> 00:28:06,777
I need you.

532
00:28:06,779 --> 00:28:09,944
<i>I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.</i>

533
00:28:09,946 --> 00:28:12,911
<i>I promise I won't do it again.</i>

534
00:28:12,913 --> 00:28:16,411
<i>And somehow,
that shit always worked.</i>

535
00:28:16,413 --> 00:28:18,277
<i>Until it didn't.</i>

536
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:22,310
<i>After all, he had me
by a four-letter word.</i>

537
00:28:22,312 --> 00:28:24,178
<i>Love.</i>

538
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:26,044
<i>And I did love him.</i>

539
00:28:26,046 --> 00:28:29,976
<i>And that part, I couldn't help,
no matter what he did.</i>

540
00:28:29,978 --> 00:28:34,044
<i>Love is a bitch when she's
chained to a tormentor.</i>

541
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:39,445
<i>And when that tormentor is a
con man, well, what do you do?</i>

542
00:28:39,447 --> 00:28:41,414
<i>Just wait for the next con.</i>

543
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,411
What?

544
00:28:43,413 --> 00:28:44,780
What is it?

545
00:28:46,747 --> 00:28:48,113
I lost
my scholarship.

546
00:28:49,746 --> 00:28:51,411
And I don't have
a way of paying for it.

547
00:28:51,413 --> 00:28:53,077
I can't get
a student loan.

548
00:28:53,079 --> 00:28:54,313
It's too late, so...

549
00:29:01,045 --> 00:29:03,210
How much are your
last two semesters?

550
00:29:03,212 --> 00:29:05,244
<i>Yep...</i>
<i>You heard me.</i>

551
00:29:05,246 --> 00:29:09,845
<i>My dumb ass paid for his two final semesters of school.</i>

552
00:29:09,847 --> 00:29:13,745
<i>I was still with my man, holding him down.
You know.</i>

553
00:29:13,747 --> 00:29:16,410
<i>My lying, cheating
son of a bitch of a man.</i>

554
00:29:16,412 --> 00:29:18,014
- <i>There I was.</i>
- You sure?

555
00:29:19,479 --> 00:29:23,178
<i>I couldn't even
believe I said it.</i>

556
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:26,944
<i>You don't have to judge me,
I'm my own jury. Okay?</i>

557
00:29:26,946 --> 00:29:30,177
<i>And I had already convicted
and sentenced myself.</i>

558
00:29:30,179 --> 00:29:33,444
<i>I was guilty of stupidity.</i>

559
00:29:33,446 --> 00:29:36,378
<i>So guess what he did when I
wrote that check?</i>

560
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:38,211
<i>You guessed it.</i>

561
00:29:38,213 --> 00:29:40,280
<i>The bastard
didn't even have a ring.</i>

562
00:29:41,312 --> 00:29:43,178
This is temporary.

563
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:46,777
One day, I'm going to replace
it with three diamonds.

564
00:29:46,779 --> 00:29:49,712
One big one in
the center for our love,

565
00:29:49,714 --> 00:29:51,711
and a yellow one
on this side

566
00:29:51,713 --> 00:29:54,445
to remind us to always
look towards the sun.

567
00:29:54,447 --> 00:29:57,911
And chocolate one on this
side that reminds us

568
00:29:57,913 --> 00:30:00,044
that there may be
dark times ahead.

569
00:30:00,046 --> 00:30:02,010
<i>And then
I heard myself say...</i>

570
00:30:02,012 --> 00:30:03,077
Yes!

571
00:30:03,079 --> 00:30:04,413
Yes! Yes!

572
00:30:15,845 --> 00:30:19,278
That man cheated on you and you almost died.

573
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:22,077
What happens when he does
something to you the next time?

574
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:23,044
There won't be...

575
00:30:23,046 --> 00:30:25,477
No, don't say there
won't be a next time.

576
00:30:25,479 --> 00:30:28,876
That man is throwing out
all kinds of red flags,

577
00:30:28,878 --> 00:30:31,711
and now, you wanna
just go and marry him?

578
00:30:31,713 --> 00:30:35,043
I can't and I will not
stand for this!

579
00:30:35,045 --> 00:30:38,246
If you go, and you go and
do that, I won't be there!

580
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:41,047
I won't.

581
00:30:41,879 --> 00:30:42,880
June.

582
00:30:44,447 --> 00:30:46,147
- This is a mistake.
- Mmm-hmm.

583
00:30:49,312 --> 00:30:50,411
<i>And yet,</i>

584
00:30:50,413 --> 00:30:53,743
<i>there I was,
walking down the aisle</i>

585
00:30:53,745 --> 00:30:57,411
<i>with more questions in my head
than petals in my bouquet.</i>

586
00:30:57,413 --> 00:31:00,010
<i>I couldn't help but look over
at the empty seats</i>

587
00:31:00,012 --> 00:31:02,477
<i>where my sisters should have
been sitting.</i>

588
00:31:02,479 --> 00:31:04,343
<i>I couldn't believe
they didn't come.</i>

589
00:31:04,345 --> 00:31:05,743
<i>But I should have understood,</i>

590
00:31:05,745 --> 00:31:09,077
<i>seeing as how I wasn't
even sure why I was there.</i>

591
00:31:09,079 --> 00:31:11,378
<i>There was Sarah at the altar,</i>

592
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:14,011
<i>my maid of honor,
cheering us on.</i>

593
00:31:14,013 --> 00:31:16,911
<i>She loved the thought of us.
I guess I did, too.</i>

594
00:31:16,913 --> 00:31:20,912
<i>But the thought of us was
better than the reality of us.</i>

595
00:31:22,146 --> 00:31:26,747
<i>And there was Robert,
standing at the altar, smiling</i>

596
00:31:27,945 --> 00:31:30,846
<i>as I walked, moth to a flame.</i>

597
00:31:32,246 --> 00:31:35,810
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

598
00:31:35,812 --> 00:31:37,146
You may kiss the bride.

599
00:31:41,112 --> 00:31:42,313
<i>Burned.</i>

600
00:31:46,012 --> 00:31:50,477
<i>Years ticked by like seconds on that
big clock in my mother's hallway.</i>

601
00:31:50,479 --> 00:31:52,976
<i>And with every tick,
there was a subtraction sign</i>

602
00:31:52,978 --> 00:31:54,444
<i>from the account for something.</i>

603
00:31:54,446 --> 00:31:57,744
<i>Something he needed,
supplies for his battery,</i>

604
00:31:57,746 --> 00:32:01,477
<i>books for research, metals,
plastics. Always something.</i>

605
00:32:01,479 --> 00:32:05,414
<i>And as the money got low,
so did his affection for me,</i>

606
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:09,244
<i>his tolerance of me,</i>

607
00:32:09,246 --> 00:32:10,713
<i>his patience.</i>

608
00:32:11,245 --> 00:32:12,477
<i>Damn.</i>

609
00:32:12,479 --> 00:32:14,812
<i>Did I just say
I was being tolerated?</i>

610
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:20,843
I need you
to see this.

611
00:32:20,845 --> 00:32:22,380
I mean, I'm worried.

612
00:32:23,913 --> 00:32:25,079
Is this right?

613
00:32:25,979 --> 00:32:26,979
Yeah.

614
00:32:27,313 --> 00:32:28,679
Damn!

615
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:30,877
I'll get a job, bae.

616
00:32:30,879 --> 00:32:32,214
I'll try to help out.

617
00:32:32,878 --> 00:32:34,211
<i>"Try"?</i>

618
00:32:34,213 --> 00:32:36,111
<i>I couldn't believe
that bastard just said "try."</i>

619
00:32:36,113 --> 00:32:38,143
But you know it's gonna be
hard for me to study

620
00:32:38,145 --> 00:32:40,844
and work, and work on this.

621
00:32:40,846 --> 00:32:44,210
But I'll try.
I mean, I will. I will.

622
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:47,011
<i>For some reason,
I just smiled.</i>

623
00:32:47,013 --> 00:32:48,244
I just need
a little more time.

624
00:32:48,246 --> 00:32:49,246
Okay.

625
00:33:03,413 --> 00:33:05,277
- Hi, Ms. Hilderbran?
- Yes.

626
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:07,776
- My name is Robert Gayle.
- I know who you are.

627
00:33:07,778 --> 00:33:10,943
Will you please stop calling
and writing letters?

628
00:33:10,945 --> 00:33:13,478
That's not how this works.
It won't get you seen.

629
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,710
It's a lottery system
for a reason.

630
00:33:15,712 --> 00:33:17,877
I know, but could you just...

631
00:33:21,913 --> 00:33:25,080
<i>Sarah helped me get a job in
her office as an office assistant.</i>

632
00:33:30,945 --> 00:33:32,280
They need these
by morning.

633
00:33:33,246 --> 00:33:34,811
- Sorry.
- Sarah.

634
00:33:34,813 --> 00:33:36,080
It's good overtime.

635
00:33:37,946 --> 00:33:40,344
<i>I was actually
working two jobs.</i>

636
00:33:40,346 --> 00:33:41,876
<i>I would leave there</i>

637
00:33:41,878 --> 00:33:44,277
<i>and clean offices at night.</i>

638
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:45,344
<i>Anything I had to do</i>

639
00:33:45,346 --> 00:33:48,177
<i>to keep from having
to ask my sisters for anything.</i>

640
00:33:48,179 --> 00:33:49,479
<i>I just...</i>

641
00:33:49,481 --> 00:33:52,444
<i>I just had to get through
the next year, you know?</i>

642
00:33:52,446 --> 00:33:55,812
<i>I thought, "Just work hard,
girl, this man loves you."</i>

643
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:07,779
Yes!

644
00:34:11,013 --> 00:34:12,014
Yes!

645
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:22,180
Yes!

646
00:34:36,746 --> 00:34:38,078
- Robert.
- Baby!

647
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:40,911
Robert, you have every
light on in this house.

648
00:34:40,913 --> 00:34:42,444
The light bill
was $300 last month!

649
00:34:42,446 --> 00:34:43,643
Baby, this won't
run up the light bill.

650
00:34:43,645 --> 00:34:46,743
This is my battery working.
It's running the whole house.

651
00:34:46,745 --> 00:34:48,776
Robert, did you
talk to an electrician?

652
00:34:48,778 --> 00:34:50,010
Why?

653
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:53,147
Oh, my God!

654
00:35:00,046 --> 00:35:01,280
Sorry.

655
00:35:03,746 --> 00:35:05,178
<i>Not only did he almost</i>

656
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:07,876
<i>burn down my mother's house,
he burned up all the wiring.</i>

657
00:35:07,878 --> 00:35:09,143
It almost worked.

658
00:35:09,145 --> 00:35:12,445
<i>Cost to repair? $37,000.</i>

659
00:35:12,447 --> 00:35:13,647
<i>That was it.</i>

660
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:15,910
<i>We were in the hole.</i>

661
00:35:15,912 --> 00:35:17,380
At least I didn't
break nothing.

662
00:35:19,812 --> 00:35:21,244
<i>Thomas Fry.</i>

663
00:35:21,246 --> 00:35:24,779
<i>But then the day came
that I had been waiting for.</i>

664
00:35:25,446 --> 00:35:27,444
<i>Robert Gayle.</i>

665
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:32,810
<i>I was so happy.</i>

666
00:35:32,812 --> 00:35:36,876
<i>I thought for sure that the very
next day, our lives would change.</i>

667
00:35:36,878 --> 00:35:38,712
<i>I thought all of our troubles
were over.</i>

668
00:35:39,946 --> 00:35:42,177
<i>I mean, he had
three job interviews.</i>

669
00:35:42,179 --> 00:35:45,347
<i>Each started
at $150,000 a year.</i>

670
00:35:46,246 --> 00:35:48,043
<i>I was so excited.</i>

671
00:35:48,045 --> 00:35:49,111
<i>But...</i>

672
00:35:49,113 --> 00:35:51,210
How could all three
turn you down?

673
00:35:51,212 --> 00:35:53,113
I mean, they recruited you.

674
00:35:54,312 --> 00:35:56,876
When I was 15,

675
00:35:56,878 --> 00:36:00,411
I was in a gang, and we
robbed a grocery store.

676
00:36:00,413 --> 00:36:02,244
I got charged as an adult,

677
00:36:02,246 --> 00:36:05,247
and I spent
two years in jail.

678
00:36:06,845 --> 00:36:08,911
I thought I could get it
expunged off my record

679
00:36:08,913 --> 00:36:11,214
since I was only 15,
but it's still there,

680
00:36:13,313 --> 00:36:16,210
and no one will
hire a felon.

681
00:36:16,212 --> 00:36:19,944
<i>You have no idea how much
I was looking forward to a break.</i>

682
00:36:19,946 --> 00:36:21,211
<i>Room to breathe, you know?</i>

683
00:36:21,213 --> 00:36:25,443
<i>To relax. Let him
take care of me for a change.</i>

684
00:36:25,445 --> 00:36:28,043
<i>But there I was, hearing this.</i>

685
00:36:28,045 --> 00:36:29,277
<i>A felon.</i>

686
00:36:29,279 --> 00:36:30,811
<i>And now, he tells me?</i>

687
00:36:30,813 --> 00:36:33,843
<i>This motherfucker
says this to me now!</i>

688
00:36:33,845 --> 00:36:35,777
<i>The con game. You see?</i>

689
00:36:35,779 --> 00:36:37,810
Baby, it's not
the end of the world.

690
00:36:38,979 --> 00:36:40,843
Look, I have an idea.

691
00:36:40,845 --> 00:36:43,476
I figured out all the bugs and
now it's even better than ever.

692
00:36:43,478 --> 00:36:45,011
I just need to
get it to Prescott.

693
00:36:45,013 --> 00:36:46,444
I know he'll
love it, okay?

694
00:36:46,446 --> 00:36:47,910
I'm still sending letters.

695
00:36:47,912 --> 00:36:49,043
I'm going by and I'm calling.

696
00:36:49,045 --> 00:36:50,343
And I'm gonna call
his secretary.

697
00:36:50,345 --> 00:36:52,409
I know we're low on money.

698
00:36:52,411 --> 00:36:55,477
But I was thinking,
if we mortgage the house,

699
00:36:55,479 --> 00:36:57,378
we can pay for the rest
of my research on this

700
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:59,044
and make it top notch,
a new design.

701
00:36:59,046 --> 00:37:00,713
I know it'll work.

702
00:37:01,245 --> 00:37:02,311
Okay.

703
00:37:02,313 --> 00:37:04,244
Mel, look at me.
I know it'll work.

704
00:37:04,246 --> 00:37:06,476
- No.
- Come on.

705
00:37:06,478 --> 00:37:08,413
Don't stop believing
in me now.

706
00:37:09,812 --> 00:37:11,910
Please trust me.

707
00:37:11,912 --> 00:37:14,178
It's gonna work,
I know it will.

708
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:15,978
<i>What the hell?</i>

709
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:20,743
<i>I felt like my back was against the
wall and I had no choice, you know?</i>

710
00:37:20,745 --> 00:37:22,311
<i>I couldn't keep doing this.</i>

711
00:37:22,313 --> 00:37:24,010
<i>I couldn't keep
working like this.</i>

712
00:37:24,012 --> 00:37:25,111
Come on.

713
00:37:25,113 --> 00:37:27,310
<i>So I had to
fall for the con.</i>

714
00:37:27,312 --> 00:37:30,943
<i>I was in too deep
to stop and walk away.</i>

715
00:37:30,945 --> 00:37:32,980
<i>So guess what
my stupid ass did.</i>

716
00:37:34,378 --> 00:37:36,811
<i>My mama's house.</i>

717
00:37:36,813 --> 00:37:41,342
<i>A house that was paid for,
that she left to me.</i>

718
00:37:41,344 --> 00:37:45,213
<i>The house that she had worked
her entire life to pay for.</i>

719
00:37:46,846 --> 00:37:48,080
<i>I mortgaged it.</i>

720
00:37:56,212 --> 00:37:57,712
Melinda!

721
00:37:59,312 --> 00:38:02,779
<i>Working to keep my sisters
from knowing what I had done.</i>

722
00:38:04,146 --> 00:38:06,976
<i>And every time I would see him
sleeping in the bed</i>

723
00:38:06,978 --> 00:38:08,976
<i>when I was headed
to one of my two jobs,</i>

724
00:38:08,978 --> 00:38:10,943
<i>I would get mad, you know?</i>

725
00:38:10,945 --> 00:38:12,646
<i>I would get resentful.</i>

726
00:38:13,879 --> 00:38:16,879
<i>And this was
my routine every day.</i>

727
00:38:22,246 --> 00:38:25,277
<i>To the bastard's credit, he did
get odd jobs from time to time.</i>

728
00:38:25,279 --> 00:38:26,411
<i>But they...</i>

729
00:38:26,413 --> 00:38:29,280
<i>They didn't even cover
the utilities most of the time.</i>

730
00:38:31,379 --> 00:38:34,910
<i>How do two people live through
two decades and miss everything?</i>

731
00:38:34,912 --> 00:38:36,246
<i>Every moment of it?</i>

732
00:38:37,378 --> 00:38:38,910
<i>I'll tell you how.</i>

733
00:38:38,912 --> 00:38:40,944
<i>You just feel trapped.</i>

734
00:38:40,946 --> 00:38:44,342
<i>But fuck that.
This trap wouldn't destroy me.</i>

735
00:38:44,344 --> 00:38:45,879
<i>Or did it?</i>

736
00:38:47,112 --> 00:38:50,276
<i>One of the saddest parts
of our lives was that</i>

737
00:38:50,278 --> 00:38:52,011
<i>we were just existing.</i>

738
00:38:52,013 --> 00:38:55,976
<i>No coloring outside
of the lines, no excitement,</i>

739
00:38:55,978 --> 00:38:58,177
<i>no birth of a child
to mark our age,</i>

740
00:38:58,179 --> 00:39:03,343
<i>or his or her first step,
or his or her graduation.</i>

741
00:39:03,345 --> 00:39:07,276
<i>Nothing to be a mile marker for
the years that were passing.</i>

742
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:09,944
<i>There were no warnings signs.</i>

743
00:39:09,946 --> 00:39:12,647
<i>Eighteen years seemed
to pass like days.</i>

744
00:39:13,478 --> 00:39:15,279
<i>How does that happen?</i>

745
00:39:27,845 --> 00:39:28,846
Diana.

746
00:39:30,278 --> 00:39:31,877
Wow. You look great.

747
00:39:31,879 --> 00:39:33,146
Robert Gayle.

748
00:39:34,013 --> 00:39:35,242
How have you been?

749
00:39:35,244 --> 00:39:36,377
I've been good.

750
00:39:36,379 --> 00:39:37,844
God, I haven't
seen you since...

751
00:39:37,846 --> 00:39:39,380
Yeah, yeah.

752
00:39:40,379 --> 00:39:44,178
She destroyed your RV.

753
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:45,243
I don't blame her though.

754
00:39:45,245 --> 00:39:46,476
You should have
been honest.

755
00:39:46,478 --> 00:39:48,209
We were kids.

756
00:39:48,211 --> 00:39:50,178
No, but you lied
to me also, Robert.

757
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,409
- I didn't know about her.
- Yeah, I know,

758
00:39:51,411 --> 00:39:52,477
I know, I'm sorry.

759
00:39:52,479 --> 00:39:54,245
Anyway, whatever
happened to her?

760
00:39:55,846 --> 00:39:57,178
I married her.

761
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:58,844
Okay.

762
00:39:58,846 --> 00:40:00,043
So what are you
doing here?

763
00:40:00,045 --> 00:40:01,242
Yeah, well, get this.

764
00:40:01,244 --> 00:40:03,843
I've been sending letters
to Prescott here for years,

765
00:40:03,845 --> 00:40:04,811
telling him about
my battery.

766
00:40:04,813 --> 00:40:07,114
You remember, in school,
what I was working on?

767
00:40:08,113 --> 00:40:09,444
No, sorry, I don't.

768
00:40:09,446 --> 00:40:11,911
Well, anyway, I've been trying
to get a meeting with him,

769
00:40:11,913 --> 00:40:14,010
and I found out that
Ms. Hilderbran retired

770
00:40:14,012 --> 00:40:15,376
and that you took
her place,

771
00:40:15,378 --> 00:40:17,476
- and congratulations, by the way.
- Mmm-hmm.

772
00:40:17,478 --> 00:40:20,877
So I figured this must be God
helping me out, you know?

773
00:40:20,879 --> 00:40:23,812
No, it's not God.
I can't help you.

774
00:40:24,712 --> 00:40:26,044
What? Why?

775
00:40:26,046 --> 00:40:29,277
No, I can't. We have new policies
now about receiving information.

776
00:40:29,279 --> 00:40:31,044
But look,
Robert, it was really...

777
00:40:31,046 --> 00:40:33,476
It was nice to see you.

778
00:40:33,478 --> 00:40:36,077
Can I take you for a coffee
sometime, maybe catch up?

779
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:38,844
Yeah, sure,
if you invite your wife.

780
00:40:38,846 --> 00:40:41,209
Look, I do not cheat
on my wife.

781
00:40:41,211 --> 00:40:42,409
I don't do that.

782
00:40:42,411 --> 00:40:44,111
This is strictly
business.

783
00:40:44,113 --> 00:40:45,843
I can't help you.

784
00:40:45,845 --> 00:40:46,976
- Look, I know.
- I'm sorry.

785
00:40:46,978 --> 00:40:50,011
I know, I understand.
I just...

786
00:40:50,013 --> 00:40:51,779
I just need some
advice, that's all.

787
00:40:55,878 --> 00:40:58,679
Okay, look.
Here's my card.

788
00:40:59,878 --> 00:41:01,944
I usually grab
coffee at Q & A

789
00:41:01,946 --> 00:41:04,443
on 52nd Street in the
mornings at about 7:00 a.m.

790
00:41:04,445 --> 00:41:06,976
- If you happen to be there...
- Yeah.

791
00:41:06,978 --> 00:41:09,476
Then maybe
we can talk, okay?

792
00:41:09,478 --> 00:41:12,043
Okay, thanks. Maybe
I'll catch you there.

793
00:41:12,045 --> 00:41:13,046
Okay.

794
00:41:17,113 --> 00:41:20,409
Carly, can you get me
the file on Robert Gayle?

795
00:41:20,411 --> 00:41:22,277
You want the file
on the psycho

796
00:41:22,279 --> 00:41:25,477
who's been sending letters
here since before I was born?

797
00:41:25,479 --> 00:41:27,046
That's what I said.

798
00:41:28,345 --> 00:41:29,409
Sure.

799
00:41:29,411 --> 00:41:30,412
Thank you.

800
00:41:39,745 --> 00:41:40,844
Hello?

801
00:41:40,846 --> 00:41:42,078
<i>Robert Gayle?</i>

802
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,176
Yeah.

803
00:41:43,178 --> 00:41:44,845
<i>My name is Melvin White.</i>

804
00:41:44,847 --> 00:41:47,744
<i>I'm the Head of Security for
Prescott and Howard Industries.</i>

805
00:41:47,746 --> 00:41:49,010
<i>I'm calling to inform you</i>

806
00:41:49,012 --> 00:41:51,476
<i>that you've been put into our
system as a credible threat.</i>

807
00:41:51,478 --> 00:41:53,309
<i>You are not to send
another letter to our office,</i>

808
00:41:53,311 --> 00:41:56,110
<i>nor contact or visit
any one of our employees.</i>

809
00:41:56,112 --> 00:41:58,877
<i>You're not to come within
300 yards of our campus.</i>

810
00:41:58,879 --> 00:42:01,747
<i>If you come near the building
again, you will be arrested.</i>

811
00:42:07,112 --> 00:42:08,377
Fuck!

812
00:42:10,278 --> 00:42:11,913
Damn it!

813
00:42:20,746 --> 00:42:21,813
What happened?

814
00:42:25,879 --> 00:42:27,744
They won't see me.

815
00:42:27,746 --> 00:42:29,911
Prescott. They won't see me!

816
00:42:29,913 --> 00:42:31,113
Okay? They won't!

817
00:42:32,379 --> 00:42:37,077
All these years wasted!

818
00:42:43,478 --> 00:42:46,711
Damn it. I wanted
this for us, baby.

819
00:42:46,713 --> 00:42:48,413
I wanted it to work for us.

820
00:42:50,879 --> 00:42:53,209
I wanted to get you that ring.

821
00:42:53,211 --> 00:42:56,342
The apartment, the boat,
the private jet.

822
00:42:56,344 --> 00:42:58,178
I wanted you to have it all.

823
00:43:01,913 --> 00:43:04,014
I wanted you to have it all.

824
00:43:08,312 --> 00:43:10,380
Have you ever
asked me what I wanted?

825
00:43:14,478 --> 00:43:16,913
I just want you to get a job,

826
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:20,345
help me out consistently,
that's all.

827
00:43:23,746 --> 00:43:27,413
Now that we know this battery
is not going to work,

828
00:43:29,878 --> 00:43:31,977
we can put it away, okay?

829
00:43:31,979 --> 00:43:33,910
Because that's over.

830
00:43:33,912 --> 00:43:35,142
That's it.

831
00:43:35,144 --> 00:43:37,312
Move on. Let's just move on.

832
00:43:38,211 --> 00:43:39,212
Okay?

833
00:43:40,445 --> 00:43:42,010
I know this could work.

834
00:43:42,012 --> 00:43:43,013
Please.

835
00:43:44,178 --> 00:43:46,142
Please.

836
00:43:46,144 --> 00:43:48,278
Please. Come on.

837
00:43:49,045 --> 00:43:50,747
Just a job.

838
00:43:53,878 --> 00:43:54,879
Okay?

839
00:43:55,845 --> 00:43:56,846
Yeah.

840
00:44:00,244 --> 00:44:02,112
I'll find the best job I can.

841
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:10,079
Baby.

842
00:44:14,145 --> 00:44:17,046
If you give up on me now,
I got nothing left.

843
00:44:20,378 --> 00:44:21,846
Tell me you love me.

844
00:44:26,245 --> 00:44:27,313
I love you.

845
00:44:28,978 --> 00:44:30,444
I do.

846
00:44:30,446 --> 00:44:32,313
But I'm so tired.

847
00:44:33,446 --> 00:44:35,146
I'm so tired.

848
00:44:39,745 --> 00:44:41,110
<i>Go, go. It's recording.</i>

849
00:44:41,112 --> 00:44:44,810
<i>Hi, my name is Robert Gayle,
and this is my wife, Mel.</i>

850
00:44:44,812 --> 00:44:47,177
<i>Hi, I'm Melinda Gayle.</i>

851
00:44:47,179 --> 00:44:50,076
<i>And we are excited to show
you my new invention!</i>

852
00:44:50,078 --> 00:44:53,176
<i>It's called The Gayle
Force Wind.</i>

853
00:44:53,178 --> 00:44:55,113
<i>And it's powering
this room right now.</i>

854
00:44:58,479 --> 00:44:59,880
Melinda?

855
00:45:00,745 --> 00:45:01,946
Melinda?

856
00:45:07,479 --> 00:45:10,043
Hey.

857
00:45:10,045 --> 00:45:13,313
Did you know this house
was about to be foreclosed on?

858
00:45:15,011 --> 00:45:16,410
Did you?

859
00:45:16,412 --> 00:45:18,042
That damn Audra
at the bank.

860
00:45:18,044 --> 00:45:20,843
She's not supposed to be
telling my business.

861
00:45:20,845 --> 00:45:23,210
Mel, that's
our cousin.

862
00:45:23,212 --> 00:45:26,647
Did you know this house was
about to be foreclosed on?

863
00:45:28,279 --> 00:45:30,277
Yeah, I was just getting
my battery ready for...

864
00:45:30,279 --> 00:45:32,077
We all know about
that damn battery.

865
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:33,410
That shit ain't
never gonna work.

866
00:45:33,412 --> 00:45:35,277
It's a joke.

867
00:45:35,279 --> 00:45:37,876
Get a job and help her.

868
00:45:37,878 --> 00:45:39,342
- Baby, that's enough, okay?
- Yes, Brenda, stop it.

869
00:45:39,344 --> 00:45:40,943
We need to be able
to talk about this.

870
00:45:40,945 --> 00:45:43,110
Melinda,
this is Mama's house.

871
00:45:43,112 --> 00:45:44,844
We grew up here.

872
00:45:44,846 --> 00:45:47,042
And you mortgaged
it for him?

873
00:45:47,044 --> 00:45:49,276
His ass needs a job.

874
00:45:49,278 --> 00:45:51,109
Why are you putting up
with this shit, huh?

875
00:45:51,111 --> 00:45:52,177
Why?

876
00:45:52,179 --> 00:45:54,409
- Brenda, let up.
- Move, Kalvin.

877
00:45:54,411 --> 00:45:57,910
The things our daddy did
to keep this house.

878
00:45:57,912 --> 00:46:00,343
And you gonna lose it?

879
00:46:00,345 --> 00:46:01,777
I knew this would happen.

880
00:46:01,779 --> 00:46:03,110
- Okay, okay. Listen.
- I knew it.

881
00:46:03,112 --> 00:46:06,009
We know the problem, and we
know you don't have the money.

882
00:46:06,011 --> 00:46:07,276
So Audra told you that, too?

883
00:46:07,278 --> 00:46:09,477
Mel, we're trying to help you.
Just listen. We have a plan.

884
00:46:09,479 --> 00:46:11,109
Babe, tell her
the plan.

885
00:46:11,111 --> 00:46:15,943
Look, Kalvin and I went to the owners of
one of the restaurants we deliver for.

886
00:46:15,945 --> 00:46:18,343
He will advance us money
for future deliveries

887
00:46:18,345 --> 00:46:19,942
three weeks at a time.

888
00:46:19,944 --> 00:46:22,710
But if we mess this up,
he'll take our trucks.

889
00:46:22,712 --> 00:46:24,777
I do not
like this at all.

890
00:46:24,779 --> 00:46:26,710
Baby, it's all right.
We're just trying to help.

891
00:46:26,712 --> 00:46:28,443
We worked our asses
off for those trucks.

892
00:46:28,445 --> 00:46:29,846
Baby, stop!

893
00:46:30,279 --> 00:46:31,647
Just listen.

894
00:46:33,044 --> 00:46:34,376
Look, man.

895
00:46:34,378 --> 00:46:39,010
All we need you to do is help us
keep the requirements, all right?

896
00:46:39,012 --> 00:46:41,843
You gotta drive and you gotta
be on time to his chains.

897
00:46:41,845 --> 00:46:42,910
That's all.

898
00:46:42,912 --> 00:46:45,376
We can get this paid back
in, like, three months.

899
00:46:45,378 --> 00:46:46,744
But you can't be late.

900
00:46:46,746 --> 00:46:49,410
You can't miss a delivery or a
pickup, or we'll lose everything.

901
00:46:49,412 --> 00:46:51,976
Everything!

902
00:46:51,978 --> 00:46:54,711
- And we can't pay you.
- And we shouldn't do it.

903
00:46:54,713 --> 00:46:57,443
He don't give a damn about
nothing and nobody but himself.

904
00:46:57,445 --> 00:46:59,744
Look, promise us that
you'll do this, Robert.

905
00:46:59,746 --> 00:47:01,775
And you'll do this right.

906
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:03,179
Promise us.

907
00:47:08,411 --> 00:47:09,412
Yeah.

908
00:47:10,411 --> 00:47:12,142
I'm in.

909
00:47:12,144 --> 00:47:13,975
See, he's in.

910
00:47:13,977 --> 00:47:16,412
I'll see you at the lot
at 6:00 a.m. tomorrow.

911
00:47:17,012 --> 00:47:18,876
I'm there.

912
00:47:18,878 --> 00:47:21,043
And I'm changing the locks.

913
00:47:21,045 --> 00:47:22,409
Mel, we're just
trying to help.

914
00:47:22,411 --> 00:47:23,477
Mmm-hmm.

915
00:47:23,479 --> 00:47:24,943
She gotta want
to help herself.

916
00:47:24,945 --> 00:47:26,009
You're right.

917
00:47:26,011 --> 00:47:27,076
- Have a good night.
- 6:00 a.m.

918
00:47:27,078 --> 00:47:28,946
He'll be there.
Just go.

919
00:47:34,978 --> 00:47:38,013
You know why I know how you
don't love me the same?

920
00:47:39,745 --> 00:47:42,112
You didn't even try
to defend me.

921
00:47:47,811 --> 00:47:51,710
<i>That bastard
actually said that to me.</i>

922
00:47:51,712 --> 00:47:53,413
<i>He actually said that.</i>

923
00:48:31,245 --> 00:48:32,775
<i>Another morning.</i>

924
00:48:32,777 --> 00:48:34,742
<i>No kiss, no hug.</i>

925
00:48:34,744 --> 00:48:35,845
Good morning.

926
00:48:37,378 --> 00:48:39,946
<i>Another night of him
sleeping downstairs.</i>

927
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:43,878
<i>At first, I was sad about it.</i>

928
00:48:44,812 --> 00:48:47,143
<i>Then I started to get mad.</i>

929
00:48:47,145 --> 00:48:48,909
<i>It's good.</i>

930
00:48:48,911 --> 00:48:51,310
Right? I mean, it's good.
At least he's working.

931
00:48:51,312 --> 00:48:52,911
Yeah, right.

932
00:48:54,011 --> 00:48:55,910
He's so mad
at me, though.

933
00:48:55,912 --> 00:48:57,975
- Is he?
- Yeah.

934
00:48:57,977 --> 00:48:59,976
He's not touching me.

935
00:48:59,978 --> 00:49:01,842
He sleeps downstairs.

936
00:49:01,844 --> 00:49:03,243
We haven't had
sex in months.

937
00:49:03,245 --> 00:49:04,309
Really?

938
00:49:04,311 --> 00:49:06,743
Yeah, it's like
we're roommates.

939
00:49:06,745 --> 00:49:09,711
Well... Hey. At least he's
a roommate with a job.

940
00:49:10,278 --> 00:49:11,409
Right.

941
00:49:11,411 --> 00:49:12,976
Yep.

942
00:49:12,978 --> 00:49:14,746
But I know that man.

943
00:49:15,278 --> 00:49:18,843
And he is very sexual.

944
00:49:18,845 --> 00:49:21,444
So if he's not getting it from me,
he's getting it from somewhere.

945
00:49:21,446 --> 00:49:24,010
No, Mel, no.

946
00:49:24,012 --> 00:49:25,812
I don't believe that,
not for one second.

947
00:49:26,877 --> 00:49:28,909
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

948
00:49:28,911 --> 00:49:31,413
I'm sure. He learned his lesson
before y'all got married.

949
00:49:32,479 --> 00:49:35,043
Okay.

950
00:49:35,045 --> 00:49:38,876
If he's cheating, he better pray
to God that I don't find out.

951
00:49:38,878 --> 00:49:41,176
Yeah, for all our sakes.

952
00:49:41,178 --> 00:49:43,042
- Stop it.
- You a little crazy.

953
00:49:43,044 --> 00:49:44,878
- Hey!
- You know it.

954
00:49:47,478 --> 00:49:49,177
<i>I love my wife.</i>

955
00:49:49,179 --> 00:49:53,743
<i>And I just wanna
do so much for her.</i>

956
00:49:53,745 --> 00:49:55,810
<i>She's done so much for me.</i>

957
00:49:55,812 --> 00:49:58,342
<i>And if you can find the time</i>

958
00:49:58,344 --> 00:50:00,975
<i>to just take a look
at the Gayle Force Wind,</i>

959
00:50:00,977 --> 00:50:04,710
<i>it will truly, truly change this planet.</i>

960
00:50:04,712 --> 00:50:05,809
<i>The Gayle Force Wind.</i>

961
00:50:07,246 --> 00:50:09,313
<i>The Gayle Force Wind.
The Gayle Force Wind.</i>

962
00:50:14,312 --> 00:50:18,277
Hey, they need this delivery
by 11:00 am this morning.

963
00:50:18,279 --> 00:50:19,976
- It's a big one.
- Okay.

964
00:50:19,978 --> 00:50:22,142
They're having a corporate
luncheon or something like that.

965
00:50:22,144 --> 00:50:25,646
All the execs will be there,
and they need this fish fresh.

966
00:50:28,412 --> 00:50:30,042
And he likes it an hour
before they open.

967
00:50:30,044 --> 00:50:31,110
Okay.

968
00:50:31,112 --> 00:50:32,876
It's our biggest client,
so you can't be late.

969
00:50:32,878 --> 00:50:34,476
- Okay.
- Look, man.

970
00:50:34,478 --> 00:50:36,076
You've been
killing it around here.

971
00:50:36,078 --> 00:50:37,809
All right.
Keep up the good work.

972
00:50:37,811 --> 00:50:39,276
And don't worry
about the Moore sisters.

973
00:50:39,278 --> 00:50:41,145
They're just close.

974
00:50:42,244 --> 00:50:43,409
Yeah.

975
00:50:43,411 --> 00:50:44,879
Yeah, I know.

976
00:50:56,078 --> 00:50:57,343
Hey.

977
00:50:57,345 --> 00:50:59,377
So, I see. You just not
gonna say nothing to him?

978
00:50:59,379 --> 00:51:00,476
Not a damn thing.

979
00:51:00,478 --> 00:51:03,145
I just need him to work,
like all of us have to do.

980
00:51:07,944 --> 00:51:11,179
Let me see, 9 times 16.

981
00:51:12,245 --> 00:51:13,278
Let's see here.

982
00:51:18,212 --> 00:51:19,212
Let's see here.

983
00:51:19,978 --> 00:51:21,279
27.

984
00:51:21,978 --> 00:51:23,112
2.

985
00:51:24,211 --> 00:51:25,245
Okay.

986
00:51:27,045 --> 00:51:28,212
What is this?

987
00:51:33,012 --> 00:51:37,176
<i>Hi, Mr. Prescott.
My name is Robert Gayle.</i>

988
00:51:37,178 --> 00:51:41,245
<i>I invented this battery,
Gayle Force Wind.</i>

989
00:51:42,211 --> 00:51:44,410
<i>I would appreciate it</i>

990
00:51:44,412 --> 00:51:46,444
<i>if you would consider
reviewing my materials.</i>

991
00:51:46,446 --> 00:51:47,709
<i>Thank you.</i>

992
00:51:47,711 --> 00:51:49,745
Are you still
watching those videos?

993
00:51:50,344 --> 00:51:51,345
Yeah.

994
00:51:55,312 --> 00:51:56,779
Is Prescott in yet?

995
00:51:57,278 --> 00:51:58,678
Let me check.

996
00:52:11,144 --> 00:52:12,210
Yeah.

997
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:14,009
<i>Hey, man. It's 9:30.</i>

998
00:52:14,011 --> 00:52:16,077
Just wanted to be sure
you're gonna be there at 11:00.

999
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:17,976
<i>Yeah.</i>

1000
00:52:17,978 --> 00:52:20,842
And I'm tracking you.
It's a lot of traffic.

1001
00:52:20,844 --> 00:52:22,942
Yeah. I'm close.

1002
00:52:22,944 --> 00:52:24,377
You the man.

1003
00:52:24,379 --> 00:52:25,910
<i>Call you when it's done.</i>

1004
00:52:25,912 --> 00:52:26,912
Okay.

1005
00:52:36,845 --> 00:52:39,742
Look, the last letter I sent was
the morning before you called.

1006
00:52:39,744 --> 00:52:40,810
You must have just gotten it.

1007
00:52:40,812 --> 00:52:42,710
I won't send another.
I won't call your office.

1008
00:52:42,712 --> 00:52:44,976
Plus, I threw the battery out,
so no need to threaten me.

1009
00:52:44,978 --> 00:52:46,009
<i>Well, that's too bad.</i>

1010
00:52:46,011 --> 00:52:49,376
<i>I saw your research.
It's brilliant.</i>

1011
00:52:49,378 --> 00:52:51,309
<i>I've shown it to Mr. Prescott.</i>

1012
00:52:51,311 --> 00:52:52,943
Oh, my God.

1013
00:52:52,945 --> 00:52:56,875
<i>He wants to meet with you today at 11:30,but
if you've thrown out the prototype...</i>

1014
00:52:56,877 --> 00:52:59,143
No, no, no.
I have it, I have it.

1015
00:52:59,145 --> 00:53:00,309
<i>Can you make it at 11:30?</i>

1016
00:53:00,311 --> 00:53:01,312
11:30.

1017
00:53:02,445 --> 00:53:04,076
Does it have to be today?

1018
00:53:04,078 --> 00:53:06,145
<i>Robert, you're joking, right?</i>

1019
00:53:08,044 --> 00:53:11,476
Yeah, yeah. Yes, yes.
I'll be there. I'll be there.

1020
00:53:11,478 --> 00:53:13,046
<i>Okay, I'll see you then.</i>

1021
00:53:16,444 --> 00:53:17,878
Oh, shit.

1022
00:53:39,745 --> 00:53:41,179
- Kalvin!
- Yo.

1023
00:53:42,712 --> 00:53:43,979
Check this out, man.

1024
00:53:47,377 --> 00:53:48,911
Where's he going?

1025
00:53:49,478 --> 00:53:51,310
Shit.

1026
00:53:51,312 --> 00:53:52,879
He's not pickin' up.

1027
00:53:56,079 --> 00:53:57,210
Babe.

1028
00:53:57,212 --> 00:53:58,343
<i>Hey, Kalvin.</i>

1029
00:53:58,345 --> 00:53:59,475
Yeah, you're not
gonna believe this.

1030
00:53:59,477 --> 00:54:00,976
- <i>What's up?</i>
- Where you at?

1031
00:54:00,978 --> 00:54:02,476
- <i>I'm going to Mel's.</i>
- You with Melinda?

1032
00:54:02,478 --> 00:54:03,410
<i>No. Not yet. What?</i>

1033
00:54:03,412 --> 00:54:04,809
It looks like
he's heading to her house.

1034
00:54:04,811 --> 00:54:05,875
<i>What?</i>

1035
00:54:05,877 --> 00:54:07,077
Yeah. Meet us
over there, all right?

1036
00:54:07,079 --> 00:54:08,408
- <i>All right.</i>
- All right. Love you.

1037
00:54:08,410 --> 00:54:09,645
Come on, man.

1038
00:54:10,112 --> 00:54:11,113
Come on.

1039
00:54:13,378 --> 00:54:14,975
Hey! Hey!

1040
00:54:44,878 --> 00:54:45,879
Hey!

1041
00:54:47,311 --> 00:54:48,776
Hey, hey, hey!

1042
00:54:48,778 --> 00:54:49,842
Sorry, sorry.

1043
00:54:49,844 --> 00:54:51,876
I need that, I need that,
I need that.

1044
00:54:51,878 --> 00:54:53,076
- That?
- Yeah, yeah.

1045
00:54:53,078 --> 00:54:54,079
Of course.

1046
00:55:01,278 --> 00:55:02,778
- Hey, Mel.
- Mmm-hmm.

1047
00:55:04,011 --> 00:55:05,812
Mel, honey,
your sisters are here.

1048
00:55:10,212 --> 00:55:13,277
This can't be good.

1049
00:55:13,279 --> 00:55:16,875
<i>Do you know what the last thing
a woman wants to hear about her man?</i>

1050
00:55:16,877 --> 00:55:18,342
<i>Is that he's cheating on her.</i>

1051
00:55:18,344 --> 00:55:19,942
Wait up, I'm coming.

1052
00:55:19,944 --> 00:55:24,177
<i>And the last person in the world
she wants to hear that shit from</i>

1053
00:55:24,179 --> 00:55:27,278
<i>is the damn family member
who told her he would.</i>

1054
00:55:44,410 --> 00:55:46,076
You're not gonna
believe this!

1055
00:55:46,078 --> 00:55:47,376
Fuck is wrong with you?

1056
00:55:47,378 --> 00:55:49,076
You're gonna cost us
our biggest client!

1057
00:55:49,078 --> 00:55:50,442
- Where the keys?
- Let me show you, man.

1058
00:55:50,444 --> 00:55:51,709
Right here.

1059
00:55:51,711 --> 00:55:52,875
What the hell is
wrong with you?

1060
00:55:52,877 --> 00:55:54,909
- You trying to destroy us?
- Look, I'm sorry!

1061
00:55:54,911 --> 00:55:56,846
- Let go, man.
- I'm sorry, man.

1062
00:56:02,711 --> 00:56:04,910
Hey, baby, you're not
gonna believe this.

1063
00:56:04,912 --> 00:56:07,178
But they called... They
called about the battery.

1064
00:56:09,078 --> 00:56:10,875
Prescott called, baby.

1065
00:56:10,877 --> 00:56:11,945
What is this?

1066
00:56:14,944 --> 00:56:17,745
Why was her wallet
in your truck?

1067
00:56:19,410 --> 00:56:20,411
What?

1068
00:56:25,277 --> 00:56:28,010
After all these years,

1069
00:56:28,012 --> 00:56:31,809
you still messin' around
with her, aren't you?

1070
00:56:31,811 --> 00:56:34,309
- Hmm? After all we've been through, Robert?
- No. Baby, no.

1071
00:56:34,311 --> 00:56:36,909
Baby, no.
I promise you. Listen.

1072
00:56:36,911 --> 00:56:38,009
I saw her.

1073
00:56:38,011 --> 00:56:40,109
It must've fallen
out in the truck.

1074
00:56:40,111 --> 00:56:43,745
Why was she
in your truck, Robert?

1075
00:56:44,812 --> 00:56:45,912
Listen, listen.

1076
00:56:47,311 --> 00:56:49,376
Listen, I gotta go.

1077
00:56:49,378 --> 00:56:52,208
- You gotta go?
- I promise you it isn't gonna... Listen.

1078
00:56:52,210 --> 00:56:54,476
I will explain everything
when I get back, okay?

1079
00:56:54,478 --> 00:56:57,909
Robert, if you walk out of that
door, there is no coming back.

1080
00:56:57,911 --> 00:57:01,775
Prescott called me. I have to go.
I have to go.

1081
00:57:01,777 --> 00:57:03,378
So you're just gonna leave?

1082
00:57:05,144 --> 00:57:06,878
You're just gonna leave?

1083
00:57:09,378 --> 00:57:11,709
Where you goin', huh?

1084
00:57:11,711 --> 00:57:14,042
Where you goin'?
Where you goin'?

1085
00:57:14,044 --> 00:57:15,276
Baby, I need my keys!

1086
00:57:15,278 --> 00:57:17,010
You ain't getting
a damn thing!

1087
00:57:17,012 --> 00:57:18,143
What, you just gonna
just leave?

1088
00:57:18,145 --> 00:57:19,375
Baby, I gotta go.
Give me the keys!

1089
00:57:19,377 --> 00:57:21,208
No! Take 'em.

1090
00:57:21,210 --> 00:57:23,077
Take 'em.
Please, take 'em.

1091
00:57:23,079 --> 00:57:24,843
I can call the cops,
I'll have your ass arrested.

1092
00:57:24,845 --> 00:57:25,909
- Take 'em!
- Damn it, baby!

1093
00:57:25,911 --> 00:57:27,309
You don't understand!
I need to see Prescott!

1094
00:57:27,311 --> 00:57:28,409
What? Her?

1095
00:57:28,411 --> 00:57:30,375
- No!
- After all these years...

1096
00:57:30,377 --> 00:57:32,678
Baby, I didn't do anything!
Baby...

1097
00:57:34,311 --> 00:57:36,341
Baby! Mel!

1098
00:57:36,343 --> 00:57:38,876
Get off of me.
Get off of me!

1099
00:57:38,878 --> 00:57:41,046
- Get your hands off of me!
- Mel, stop!

1100
00:57:43,945 --> 00:57:46,241
- Mel, you need to stop!
- No!

1101
00:57:46,243 --> 00:57:48,109
- Stop it!
- Melinda!

1102
00:57:48,111 --> 00:57:49,745
- Give me the damn keys!
- Melin...

1103
00:57:51,078 --> 00:57:53,678
- Get off of her!
- Get off of her!

1104
00:57:55,410 --> 00:57:57,976
Get your ass off
of my sister!

1105
00:57:57,978 --> 00:57:59,308
No! Get off of me
so I can...

1106
00:57:59,310 --> 00:58:01,710
Get off of me!
Don't let him go!

1107
00:58:01,712 --> 00:58:03,311
- Come on! Help me!
- Don't let him go!

1108
00:58:05,211 --> 00:58:06,375
Don't let him go!

1109
00:58:06,377 --> 00:58:09,943
Don't let him go!
You're letting him go!

1110
00:58:09,945 --> 00:58:11,845
Why are you letting him go?

1111
00:58:13,278 --> 00:58:14,476
You better not come back!

1112
00:58:14,478 --> 00:58:17,476
- Go!
- Don't let him go!

1113
00:58:17,478 --> 00:58:19,712
Help me, June.
Get her up here. Go!

1114
00:58:30,744 --> 00:58:31,745
Damn it.

1115
00:59:12,411 --> 00:59:14,175
Robert.

1116
00:59:14,177 --> 00:59:16,109
What a way to make the
wrong first impression.

1117
00:59:16,111 --> 00:59:17,610
- You look terrible.
- I'm sorry.

1118
00:59:17,612 --> 00:59:21,075
Gonna be hard to convince people
you're not crazy looking like this.

1119
00:59:21,077 --> 00:59:22,645
Follow me, come on.

1120
00:59:34,778 --> 00:59:36,776
Are you okay?

1121
00:59:36,778 --> 00:59:37,842
Robert.

1122
00:59:37,844 --> 00:59:39,876
My wife...

1123
00:59:39,878 --> 00:59:42,176
You're melting down.

1124
00:59:42,178 --> 00:59:44,442
You left this
in my truck.

1125
00:59:44,444 --> 00:59:46,211
Robert, did you
steal my wallet?

1126
00:59:47,912 --> 00:59:50,209
You left it
in my truck.

1127
00:59:50,211 --> 00:59:52,312
No, Robert. Is this
what this is about?

1128
00:59:53,043 --> 00:59:54,211
Did she find it?

1129
00:59:54,945 --> 00:59:56,375
I'm so sorry.

1130
00:59:56,377 --> 01:00:00,341
I got nothing left. Okay?
I got nothing left.

1131
01:00:00,343 --> 01:00:03,443
Yeah, I risked everything for
this meeting with Prescott, okay?

1132
01:00:03,445 --> 01:00:05,008
And I'm not even
sure if I can do this.

1133
01:00:05,010 --> 01:00:08,376
Look... Look at me,
Robert! Look at me.

1134
01:00:08,378 --> 01:00:10,242
If this is as good
as your research suggests

1135
01:00:10,244 --> 01:00:12,075
then your dreams
have come true.

1136
01:00:12,077 --> 01:00:15,108
Now you need to put
the personal shit aside

1137
01:00:15,110 --> 01:00:17,244
and you go in there
and you own that room.

1138
01:00:17,878 --> 01:00:18,879
You got me?

1139
01:00:21,811 --> 01:00:23,144
Come on, let's go.

1140
01:00:24,177 --> 01:00:25,178
Leave that.

1141
01:00:45,745 --> 01:00:48,746
Mr. Prescott,
this is Robert Gayle.

1142
01:00:49,712 --> 01:00:51,409
The persistent Mr. Gayle.

1143
01:00:51,411 --> 01:00:53,443
Like a Gayle force wind.

1144
01:00:53,445 --> 01:00:55,245
All right.
Let's hear this pitch.

1145
01:01:01,010 --> 01:01:03,111
What happened?
Did we make it in time?

1146
01:01:03,343 --> 01:01:04,476
No.

1147
01:01:04,478 --> 01:01:06,112
So we're gonna
lose our trucks?

1148
01:01:07,943 --> 01:01:11,308
- We can keep the trucks.
- We lost him as a client.

1149
01:01:11,310 --> 01:01:13,745
He won't give us the money for this house.

1150
01:01:16,712 --> 01:01:18,045
It's gonna be
okay, baby.

1151
01:01:20,943 --> 01:01:22,244
Is she okay?

1152
01:01:24,210 --> 01:01:25,278
No.

1153
01:01:26,344 --> 01:01:28,809
<i>I wasn't.</i>

1154
01:01:28,811 --> 01:01:30,645
<i>I was in that place that
scares me.</i>

1155
01:01:32,044 --> 01:01:34,710
<i>That place between present
and furious.</i>

1156
01:01:34,712 --> 01:01:37,341
<i>I had lost all rhyme
and reason.</i>

1157
01:01:37,343 --> 01:01:39,974
<i>It's like nothing mattered
but getting even.</i>

1158
01:01:39,976 --> 01:01:43,276
<i>I was told I get it from my
daddy, but his was quiet.</i>

1159
01:01:43,278 --> 01:01:45,208
<i>Mine...</i>

1160
01:01:45,210 --> 01:01:47,941
<i>I would burn a whole house
down with me in it</i>

1161
01:01:47,943 --> 01:01:51,175
<i>to get to the motherfucker
that done me wrong.</i>

1162
01:01:51,177 --> 01:01:54,375
And the lipo and nickel,
and the Gayle Force Wind...

1163
01:01:54,377 --> 01:01:56,078
Okay, I've heard
enough.

1164
01:01:57,177 --> 01:01:59,309
Our team has received
your research.

1165
01:01:59,311 --> 01:02:02,875
They believe it can work, even
though you don't have a prototype.

1166
01:02:02,877 --> 01:02:07,476
We wanna offer you
$800,000 today

1167
01:02:07,478 --> 01:02:12,076
for all your notes, and research,
and any plans that you have.

1168
01:02:12,078 --> 01:02:14,846
You will have to sign
a non-compete, of course.

1169
01:02:15,478 --> 01:02:17,678
$800,000...

1170
01:02:20,244 --> 01:02:23,012
You wanna buy...
Buy my work?

1171
01:02:23,712 --> 01:02:24,911
Yes.

1172
01:02:25,943 --> 01:02:28,042
That's how this goes.

1173
01:02:28,044 --> 01:02:30,945
We are prepared to write
you a check today.

1174
01:02:31,478 --> 01:02:33,244
Um...

1175
01:02:35,378 --> 01:02:38,375
No offense, Mr. Prescott...

1176
01:02:38,377 --> 01:02:40,875
I have no intentions
of selling my work.

1177
01:02:40,877 --> 01:02:46,443
I wanna own my copyrights and
license it to you for a term.

1178
01:02:46,445 --> 01:02:50,712
And when this thing hits the market,
it will bring billions to your firm.

1179
01:02:53,043 --> 01:02:57,008
I only think it's right for me
to participate in that upside.

1180
01:02:57,010 --> 01:03:02,309
Yes. But I would be taking all the risk
and spending all the money to perfect it.

1181
01:03:02,311 --> 01:03:06,709
$800,000 is my offer
to you, Mr. Gayle.

1182
01:03:06,711 --> 01:03:08,244
And it's not changing.

1183
01:03:09,843 --> 01:03:11,678
Take it or leave it.

1184
01:03:19,078 --> 01:03:20,278
Um...

1185
01:03:22,278 --> 01:03:23,779
I'm gonna have to say no.

1186
01:03:27,944 --> 01:03:30,412
I'm sorry to have
wasted your time.

1187
01:03:30,976 --> 01:03:32,411
Sure. Okay.

1188
01:03:35,343 --> 01:03:38,344
- Well, thank you.
- Sorry, Mr. Prescott.

1189
01:03:59,044 --> 01:04:00,944
Robert. Robert!

1190
01:04:01,811 --> 01:04:03,178
Wait, Robert!

1191
01:04:07,010 --> 01:04:08,874
There's no way
I can take that deal.

1192
01:04:08,876 --> 01:04:11,012
- It's a lot of money.
- Not for him.

1193
01:04:12,243 --> 01:04:13,378
This is my life.

1194
01:04:17,078 --> 01:04:18,745
What did I do?

1195
01:04:21,377 --> 01:04:22,410
I'm sorry.

1196
01:04:22,412 --> 01:04:25,012
Robert, I'm sorry,
especially about the wallet.

1197
01:04:25,910 --> 01:04:27,778
Robert. Robert.

1198
01:04:45,445 --> 01:04:47,312
Look, first let me
just say this.

1199
01:04:48,410 --> 01:04:52,709
I did not do
anything with Diana.

1200
01:04:52,711 --> 01:04:54,774
I found out that
she worked at Prescott,

1201
01:04:54,776 --> 01:04:56,376
and we went out for coffee
to talk business,

1202
01:04:56,378 --> 01:04:58,443
and that was it.

1203
01:04:58,445 --> 01:05:00,376
And she got into the truck
because her daddy

1204
01:05:00,378 --> 01:05:02,909
was some kind of driver
or something like that.

1205
01:05:02,911 --> 01:05:05,309
And her... Her wallet
fell out of her purse.

1206
01:05:05,311 --> 01:05:07,908
Look, listen, I know it makes
no damn sense,

1207
01:05:07,910 --> 01:05:09,378
but it's the truth.

1208
01:05:15,976 --> 01:05:18,708
And the reason why
I didn't make the deliveries

1209
01:05:18,710 --> 01:05:20,944
because Prescott
called me, baby,

1210
01:05:22,410 --> 01:05:24,177
to see the battery.

1211
01:05:25,244 --> 01:05:28,375
They offered me $800,000.

1212
01:05:28,377 --> 01:05:30,874
And he was ready
to write that check today.

1213
01:05:30,876 --> 01:05:33,944
And I'm sure if I had a prototype,
it would have been a lot more.

1214
01:05:34,877 --> 01:05:38,309
$800,000 today?

1215
01:05:38,311 --> 01:05:40,842
- Yeah.
- You need to take the money.

1216
01:05:40,844 --> 01:05:41,975
Look, I can't.

1217
01:05:41,977 --> 01:05:44,245
There is no damn
money. He lying.

1218
01:05:45,944 --> 01:05:47,112
Baby...

1219
01:05:50,043 --> 01:05:52,975
- Can we talk by ourselves?
- Sure.

1220
01:05:52,977 --> 01:05:54,144
Sure.

1221
01:05:55,277 --> 01:05:57,312
Just let me
understand this.

1222
01:06:00,077 --> 01:06:04,775
Some random bitch that I
caught you with before

1223
01:06:04,777 --> 01:06:07,111
just happens to be
in your truck

1224
01:06:08,078 --> 01:06:09,911
and leaves her wallet?

1225
01:06:11,477 --> 01:06:14,944
This house is getting
foreclosed on.

1226
01:06:16,877 --> 01:06:21,242
And you turned down
an $800,000 check

1227
01:06:21,244 --> 01:06:23,112
that Mr. Prescott

1228
01:06:24,111 --> 01:06:25,978
was gonna write
you today?

1229
01:06:27,743 --> 01:06:29,974
Is this the bullshit
you selling me?

1230
01:06:29,976 --> 01:06:31,142
Baby, this is
not bullshit.

1231
01:06:31,144 --> 01:06:32,476
Then call him
and take the offer.

1232
01:06:32,478 --> 01:06:34,409
It's not a good offer.

1233
01:06:34,411 --> 01:06:37,241
- It's not a good offer, baby.
- It's not a good offer.

1234
01:06:37,243 --> 01:06:39,378
So I just lose
my mother's house?

1235
01:06:41,944 --> 01:06:44,042
Baby, I'll buy you
a bigger house.

1236
01:06:44,044 --> 01:06:46,275
As a matter of fact,

1237
01:06:46,277 --> 01:06:51,209
we're gonna live in a high-rise
building overlooking the city.

1238
01:06:51,211 --> 01:06:53,245
And that diamond...

1239
01:06:55,277 --> 01:06:56,378
I'mma get you.

1240
01:06:57,876 --> 01:07:01,841
And <i>The Mrs. Gayle,</i>
private jet.

1241
01:07:01,843 --> 01:07:03,708
We're gonna
make it, baby.

1242
01:07:03,710 --> 01:07:04,841
This is it.

1243
01:07:04,843 --> 01:07:06,177
No, we're not.

1244
01:07:08,078 --> 01:07:09,878
No, we're not
gonna make it.

1245
01:07:11,911 --> 01:07:13,344
You had a good woman.

1246
01:07:17,876 --> 01:07:19,378
I would do
anything for you.

1247
01:07:20,976 --> 01:07:22,111
And I did.

1248
01:07:24,377 --> 01:07:26,011
And you lie

1249
01:07:26,743 --> 01:07:29,044
and you cheat on me.

1250
01:07:35,277 --> 01:07:37,644
You're
a motherfucking loser.

1251
01:07:39,977 --> 01:07:42,145
Don't talk to me like
that, baby, please.

1252
01:07:44,110 --> 01:07:47,176
I'm done with you.
I'm done.

1253
01:07:47,178 --> 01:07:51,344
I need you to get your shit while
you can, and I need you to get out.

1254
01:07:52,343 --> 01:07:53,711
I want a divorce.

1255
01:07:54,877 --> 01:07:55,877
Mel...

1256
01:07:58,211 --> 01:07:59,275
Mel, please.

1257
01:07:59,277 --> 01:08:01,242
- No.
- Mel, I love you.

1258
01:08:01,244 --> 01:08:02,841
Please.

1259
01:08:02,843 --> 01:08:04,143
You're really gonna
do this?

1260
01:08:04,145 --> 01:08:07,375
Why don't you go find that
bitch and let her take you in?

1261
01:08:07,377 --> 01:08:09,044
- Get out.
- Mel.

1262
01:08:09,876 --> 01:08:11,710
Get out!

1263
01:08:14,877 --> 01:08:16,942
Come on, man.
You should leave.

1264
01:08:16,944 --> 01:08:18,178
I'm not leaving.

1265
01:08:23,710 --> 01:08:25,044
You know me.

1266
01:08:28,445 --> 01:08:31,778
You know I can be the
motherfucking devil.

1267
01:09:24,977 --> 01:09:27,808
<i>Three months later,
I lost my mama's house.</i>

1268
01:09:27,810 --> 01:09:30,777
<i>You know, that bastard didn't
even call to see if I was okay.</i>

1269
01:09:31,976 --> 01:09:33,874
<i>He didn't even bother.</i>

1270
01:09:33,876 --> 01:09:35,378
<i>He was done with me.</i>

1271
01:09:37,711 --> 01:09:39,112
<i>He had gotten all he could.</i>

1272
01:09:40,843 --> 01:09:44,208
<i>I guess he was off looking
for his next victim.</i>

1273
01:09:44,210 --> 01:09:46,241
<i>Not caring that I was
devastated.</i>

1274
01:09:46,243 --> 01:09:49,044
<i>I can't believe
I let that son of a bitch...</i>

1275
01:09:50,343 --> 01:09:51,777
<i>Damn.</i>

1276
01:10:08,777 --> 01:10:10,841
<i>I was humiliated.</i>

1277
01:10:10,843 --> 01:10:12,710
<i>I had to move in
with my sister.</i>

1278
01:10:15,444 --> 01:10:18,975
<i>At this age,
living with my sister?</i>

1279
01:10:18,977 --> 01:10:21,842
<i>All I needed was
a bunch of damn cats.</i>

1280
01:10:21,844 --> 01:10:23,144
<i>Fuck him!</i>

1281
01:10:53,211 --> 01:10:55,045
Who the hell took
my damn phone?

1282
01:10:57,810 --> 01:11:00,709
<i>I had wasted
too many years with Robert.</i>

1283
01:11:00,711 --> 01:11:04,442
<i>Too many years feeling lonely
whenever he was around.</i>

1284
01:11:04,444 --> 01:11:07,975
<i>Thought it was time for me
to move on, and so did Brenda.</i>

1285
01:11:07,977 --> 01:11:11,775
<i>So she wasted no time trying to
get me hooked up with Devon.</i>

1286
01:11:11,777 --> 01:11:14,041
<i>She heard that he was divorced.</i>

1287
01:11:14,043 --> 01:11:20,209
<i>So, much to my disapproval, she
called him up and we went out.</i>

1288
01:11:20,211 --> 01:11:24,212
<i>My divorce wasn't even final,
but what the hell.</i>

1289
01:11:27,111 --> 01:11:29,475
<i>So there I was, out with a man.</i>

1290
01:11:29,477 --> 01:11:31,407
<i>A man that could pay the check</i>

1291
01:11:31,409 --> 01:11:34,176
<i>and who commanded attention
when he walked into the room.</i>

1292
01:11:34,178 --> 01:11:35,645
<i>All eyes on him.</i>

1293
01:11:36,310 --> 01:11:37,945
<i>And yet, it felt strange.</i>

1294
01:11:38,911 --> 01:11:41,375
<i>It felt foreign. It felt wrong.</i>

1295
01:11:41,377 --> 01:11:43,742
<i>It... It was like I was
starting over</i>

1296
01:11:43,744 --> 01:11:47,874
<i>and learning how things
were really supposed to be.</i>

1297
01:11:47,876 --> 01:11:50,942
<i>And I thought about Robert
from time to time.</i>

1298
01:11:50,944 --> 01:11:53,774
<i>Sometimes with sympathy,
but mostly with anger.</i>

1299
01:11:53,776 --> 01:11:57,109
<i>Especially when I looked up
and saw his ass.</i>

1300
01:11:57,111 --> 01:12:01,142
<i>There he was in the damn
kitchen, washing dishes.</i>

1301
01:12:01,144 --> 01:12:05,374
<i>All that money I wasted helping him,
and his ass is in the damn kitchen?</i>

1302
01:12:05,376 --> 01:12:07,375
<i>Of all restaurants!</i>

1303
01:12:07,377 --> 01:12:09,709
<i>I got mad all over again.</i>

1304
01:12:09,711 --> 01:12:15,975
<i>I wanted my $1,234,908.07</i>

1305
01:12:15,977 --> 01:12:18,975
<i>And that's with him
paying me back every dime,</i>

1306
01:12:18,977 --> 01:12:22,275
<i>and then half of all
the bills for all those years.</i>

1307
01:12:22,277 --> 01:12:24,908
<i>Looks like his ass will be
washing a lot of dishes</i>

1308
01:12:24,910 --> 01:12:26,407
<i>to pay me back.</i>

1309
01:12:26,409 --> 01:12:28,241
<i>Fuck it, I'll cut my losses.</i>

1310
01:12:28,243 --> 01:12:29,645
<i>Just give me a divorce.</i>

1311
01:12:37,776 --> 01:12:39,044
Sorry, I'm late.

1312
01:12:44,243 --> 01:12:45,845
It's a family
divorce, I see.

1313
01:12:46,376 --> 01:12:47,910
She wanted us here.

1314
01:12:48,911 --> 01:12:50,911
Is your lawyer here,
Mr. Gayle?

1315
01:12:52,944 --> 01:12:54,275
I can't afford a lawyer.

1316
01:12:54,277 --> 01:12:57,209
No, you can't,
working as a dishwasher.

1317
01:12:57,211 --> 01:13:00,208
Ma'am, you're a guest
in this mediation.

1318
01:13:00,210 --> 01:13:01,410
Please.

1319
01:13:02,844 --> 01:13:05,045
Mel, are you sure
you wanna do this?

1320
01:13:06,078 --> 01:13:08,742
I still love you so much.

1321
01:13:08,744 --> 01:13:10,042
I do.

1322
01:13:10,044 --> 01:13:14,274
We're prepared to let you have
the car and your clothes.

1323
01:13:14,276 --> 01:13:16,408
No, no. You keep it.

1324
01:13:16,410 --> 01:13:18,945
Keep it all. Everything.
I don't want anything.

1325
01:13:20,242 --> 01:13:22,910
I just wanna say this,
and I'm done.

1326
01:13:24,877 --> 01:13:28,012
Mel, I am so sorry that
I couldn't be what you needed.

1327
01:13:29,110 --> 01:13:31,042
But I...

1328
01:13:31,044 --> 01:13:35,378
I never cheated on you again
after I saw what it did to you.

1329
01:13:38,376 --> 01:13:40,341
I found out what love is

1330
01:13:40,343 --> 01:13:42,878
for the first time in my life
because of you.

1331
01:13:44,776 --> 01:13:48,410
I can honestly say with all
my heart that I love you.

1332
01:13:50,444 --> 01:13:52,145
I will always love you, Mel.

1333
01:13:58,343 --> 01:13:59,344
I'm sorry.

1334
01:14:03,476 --> 01:14:04,911
I'm sorry, Mel.

1335
01:14:09,443 --> 01:14:11,111
Please, Mel, just...

1336
01:14:11,843 --> 01:14:12,977
Just look at me.

1337
01:14:50,410 --> 01:14:52,809
Well...

1338
01:14:52,811 --> 01:14:56,811
At least you don't have to give
that bastard another thing.

1339
01:15:12,911 --> 01:15:14,045
Hello?

1340
01:15:15,910 --> 01:15:18,207
- Hello?
- <i>Hello.</i>

1341
01:15:18,209 --> 01:15:20,107
Where the hell have you been?

1342
01:15:20,109 --> 01:15:22,175
<i>Someone stole my phone. Sorry.</i>

1343
01:15:22,177 --> 01:15:23,774
<i>I've been trying
to reach you all week.</i>

1344
01:15:23,776 --> 01:15:25,307
I'm sorry.

1345
01:15:25,309 --> 01:15:26,742
<i>So Victor called.</i>

1346
01:15:26,744 --> 01:15:30,174
<i>He said that you called him
to represent you in the deal.</i>

1347
01:15:30,176 --> 01:15:32,074
If there's ever a deal.

1348
01:15:32,076 --> 01:15:34,075
Prescott will come back, okay?
You'll see.

1349
01:15:34,077 --> 01:15:36,341
<i>Just keep your fingers crossed.</i>

1350
01:15:36,343 --> 01:15:39,009
<i>Hey, I asked Victor for your home
address or your phone number,</i>

1351
01:15:39,011 --> 01:15:41,474
and he said he had
to wait for you to call him.

1352
01:15:41,476 --> 01:15:43,310
<i>What's going on, Robert?</i>

1353
01:15:44,210 --> 01:15:46,241
I'm just... I'm just...

1354
01:15:46,243 --> 01:15:49,045
We're just between
places right now.

1355
01:15:50,076 --> 01:15:51,810
Robert, did she put you out?

1356
01:15:54,377 --> 01:15:55,977
Um...

1357
01:15:57,911 --> 01:15:59,442
We're... We're divorced now.

1358
01:15:59,444 --> 01:16:00,942
<i>I've been staying in the
Genesis Shelter</i>

1359
01:16:00,944 --> 01:16:05,474
<i>on 4th for the past 3 months,
and I'm just...</i>

1360
01:16:05,476 --> 01:16:06,874
I'm coming to get you.

1361
01:16:06,876 --> 01:16:08,211
<i>No, Diana.</i>

1362
01:16:15,376 --> 01:16:17,009
You okay, baby?

1363
01:16:17,011 --> 01:16:18,711
She is fine.

1364
01:16:19,410 --> 01:16:21,742
More champagne?

1365
01:16:21,744 --> 01:16:23,845
She's celebrating
her divorce.

1366
01:16:26,342 --> 01:16:28,941
But my favorite part

1367
01:16:28,943 --> 01:16:32,974
is when that bastard said
how much he loved her.

1368
01:16:32,976 --> 01:16:34,777
I almost threw up.

1369
01:16:37,109 --> 01:16:39,175
You know I never thought
he was lying to you, Mel.

1370
01:16:39,177 --> 01:16:40,875
I always believed
he loved you.

1371
01:16:40,877 --> 01:16:42,678
You would,
but she didn't.

1372
01:16:43,744 --> 01:16:45,241
<i>I did believe him.</i>

1373
01:16:45,243 --> 01:16:47,742
<i>I even felt sorry for him.</i>

1374
01:16:47,744 --> 01:16:49,841
<i>What is that about us as women?</i>

1375
01:16:49,843 --> 01:16:53,274
<i>Why do we feel bad
when we didn't do shit, huh?</i>

1376
01:16:53,276 --> 01:16:55,874
<i>And yet, there I was
feeling bad about him.</i>

1377
01:16:55,876 --> 01:16:57,942
<i>Feeling sad
that he never made it.</i>

1378
01:16:57,944 --> 01:16:59,775
<i>That he was a dishwasher.</i>

1379
01:16:59,777 --> 01:17:01,311
<i>Why the hell should I care?</i>

1380
01:17:02,110 --> 01:17:04,441
<i>So you know what I did?</i>

1381
01:17:04,443 --> 01:17:07,407
<i>I got that tall, sexy thing
standing over there</i>

1382
01:17:07,409 --> 01:17:09,208
<i>to take my mind off it.</i>

1383
01:17:09,210 --> 01:17:10,908
Can we go back
to your place?

1384
01:17:10,910 --> 01:17:12,909
- Now?
- Yeah.

1385
01:17:12,911 --> 01:17:15,207
So sorry. Good night, folks.
I'm outta here.

1386
01:17:15,209 --> 01:17:16,808
Go on, Devon.
It was nice to see you.

1387
01:17:16,810 --> 01:17:17,944
- Get home safe.
- Brenda.

1388
01:17:19,177 --> 01:17:20,311
Babe, wait up.

1389
01:17:26,042 --> 01:17:27,910
This will do you good.

1390
01:17:30,242 --> 01:17:31,244
Thanks.

1391
01:17:32,410 --> 01:17:33,411
Sure.

1392
01:17:36,043 --> 01:17:38,442
You should have told me
you were in a shelter.

1393
01:17:41,243 --> 01:17:42,410
Doesn't matter.

1394
01:17:44,143 --> 01:17:47,908
Robert, I know you're upset
that you lost your wife,

1395
01:17:47,910 --> 01:17:50,343
but listen to me.

1396
01:17:53,009 --> 01:17:54,410
It's okay.

1397
01:17:56,810 --> 01:17:59,076
Sometimes things just happen,
you know?

1398
01:18:03,276 --> 01:18:06,141
I'm a firm believer
that when

1399
01:18:06,143 --> 01:18:08,143
someone falls out
of your life maybe...

1400
01:18:09,176 --> 01:18:12,074
Maybe they're
supposed to.

1401
01:18:12,076 --> 01:18:15,243
Maybe they're not supposed to share
the level that you're going to.

1402
01:18:17,843 --> 01:18:20,076
Maybe you're supposed
to leave them behind.

1403
01:18:23,810 --> 01:18:26,943
I hate seeing you this broken,
this defeated.

1404
01:18:29,976 --> 01:18:32,645
You're a good man, Robert.
You are.

1405
01:18:34,942 --> 01:18:36,744
And you're gonna be okay.

1406
01:18:39,043 --> 01:18:41,211
I know that you'll be okay.

1407
01:18:46,143 --> 01:18:49,809
<i>Devon was just okay
in bed, but he wasn't Robert.</i>

1408
01:18:49,811 --> 01:18:51,908
<i>Robert mastered my body.</i>

1409
01:18:51,910 --> 01:18:53,041
<i>He knew my curves.</i>

1410
01:18:53,043 --> 01:18:56,275
<i>He knew how I liked it
slightly to the left.</i>

1411
01:18:56,277 --> 01:18:59,040
<i>Robert would at least
try to hold me.</i>

1412
01:18:59,042 --> 01:19:01,374
<i>And the thought of him
being with another woman</i>

1413
01:19:01,376 --> 01:19:02,874
<i>still made me jealous.</i>

1414
01:19:02,876 --> 01:19:03,808
Good night.

1415
01:19:03,810 --> 01:19:05,408
<i>You know what I found out?</i>

1416
01:19:05,410 --> 01:19:08,340
<i>The truth always comes
when a man comes.</i>

1417
01:19:08,342 --> 01:19:10,240
<i>When Devon was finished,
he was done.</i>

1418
01:19:10,242 --> 01:19:11,175
Good night.

1419
01:19:11,177 --> 01:19:12,973
<i>Didn't matter
what I felt.</i>

1420
01:19:12,975 --> 01:19:15,308
You gotta take
me home.

1421
01:19:15,310 --> 01:19:17,940
You wore me out.
Don't you wanna stay?

1422
01:19:17,942 --> 01:19:19,343
No! Take me home.

1423
01:19:39,943 --> 01:19:41,111
Still asleep?

1424
01:19:43,476 --> 01:19:44,808
Shit. Damn it.

1425
01:19:44,810 --> 01:19:47,175
I can't believe
I slept this long.

1426
01:19:47,177 --> 01:19:49,040
I gotta get to
the restaurant.

1427
01:19:49,042 --> 01:19:50,808
I called them
and told them you quit.

1428
01:19:50,810 --> 01:19:52,174
What? What?

1429
01:19:52,176 --> 01:19:55,241
No, Diana, you have no idea how hard
it is for me to get a damn job.

1430
01:19:55,243 --> 01:19:56,378
Why would you do that?

1431
01:20:01,776 --> 01:20:02,910
What's this?

1432
01:20:16,176 --> 01:20:17,343
Is this real?

1433
01:20:19,176 --> 01:20:20,310
Yeah.

1434
01:20:31,209 --> 01:20:33,374
This is...
This is the offer?

1435
01:20:33,376 --> 01:20:35,341
Yeah.

1436
01:20:35,343 --> 01:20:38,307
I begged Victor
to let me tell you.

1437
01:20:38,309 --> 01:20:41,176
I'm pretty sure this is
Prescott's best and final.

1438
01:20:42,942 --> 01:20:44,341
And this the best
part, Robert,

1439
01:20:44,343 --> 01:20:46,841
that this is a license
for the technology.

1440
01:20:46,843 --> 01:20:48,411
You still own the IP.

1441
01:20:51,109 --> 01:20:52,276
You did it.

1442
01:20:53,909 --> 01:20:55,010
You did it.

1443
01:21:13,210 --> 01:21:14,341
- Mel.
- What?

1444
01:21:14,343 --> 01:21:16,074
Melinda!

1445
01:21:16,076 --> 01:21:17,943
- What?
- Look.

1446
01:21:22,176 --> 01:21:23,710
What the hell?

1447
01:21:25,243 --> 01:21:26,810
- No way.
- Go.

1448
01:21:50,143 --> 01:21:51,408
How are you?

1449
01:21:51,410 --> 01:21:53,740
I'm busy.

1450
01:21:53,742 --> 01:21:55,343
I just need 10 minutes
of your time.

1451
01:21:56,110 --> 01:21:57,244
You have two.

1452
01:21:58,443 --> 01:22:00,773
Okay.

1453
01:22:00,775 --> 01:22:03,974
I just wanted to come here to
tell you thank you for loving me.

1454
01:22:03,976 --> 01:22:05,810
You know, there were times
when I doubted myself...

1455
01:22:08,043 --> 01:22:10,840
You kept working
and kept me believing.

1456
01:22:10,842 --> 01:22:14,241
Um... We are never
getting back together.

1457
01:22:14,243 --> 01:22:15,308
- Okay?
- Yeah.

1458
01:22:15,310 --> 01:22:17,177
- Never.
- I know.

1459
01:22:18,775 --> 01:22:20,807
So what is this?

1460
01:22:20,809 --> 01:22:24,308
You borrow a suit, and you
come up here and try to...

1461
01:22:24,310 --> 01:22:26,411
Impress me?

1462
01:22:26,976 --> 01:22:28,011
For what?

1463
01:22:28,975 --> 01:22:30,377
My battery. It...

1464
01:22:31,875 --> 01:22:33,708
It hit.

1465
01:22:33,710 --> 01:22:36,007
Yeah. I signed a deal.

1466
01:22:36,009 --> 01:22:38,344
And I'm in business
with Prescott.

1467
01:22:40,310 --> 01:22:41,710
Good for you.

1468
01:22:49,310 --> 01:22:50,676
Good for us.

1469
01:22:54,276 --> 01:22:57,475
I know our divorce is finalized,
but I wanted you to have this

1470
01:22:57,477 --> 01:22:59,874
for everything you've done
for me over the years.

1471
01:22:59,876 --> 01:23:03,207
I don't know of any woman who
would have put up with me,

1472
01:23:03,209 --> 01:23:05,809
loved me, cared for me...

1473
01:23:06,942 --> 01:23:08,676
Believed in me.

1474
01:23:09,277 --> 01:23:11,475
I don't blame you.

1475
01:23:11,477 --> 01:23:14,974
Like I said, I started
to doubt myself.

1476
01:23:14,976 --> 01:23:17,976
I'm just sorry that my dream
took so long to come true.

1477
01:23:19,242 --> 01:23:21,074
Anyway, look.

1478
01:23:21,076 --> 01:23:24,210
You gave me two minutes,
I'm sure it's just about up.

1479
01:23:25,043 --> 01:23:26,311
I love you, Mel.

1480
01:23:28,176 --> 01:23:29,378
I always will.

1481
01:23:34,276 --> 01:23:36,809
Oh. I almost forgot.

1482
01:23:39,043 --> 01:23:40,177
Your mama's house.

1483
01:23:41,976 --> 01:23:43,340
It's yours again.

1484
01:23:43,342 --> 01:23:45,474
Might look a little
different on the inside

1485
01:23:45,476 --> 01:23:47,143
'cause of the last
owners, but...

1486
01:23:47,976 --> 01:23:49,744
It's yours.

1487
01:24:26,242 --> 01:24:28,840
- You're taking all day, baby.
- My partner got it.

1488
01:24:28,842 --> 01:24:30,107
It's mine.

1489
01:24:30,109 --> 01:24:31,808
- Bam!
- Boo.

1490
01:24:31,810 --> 01:24:33,075
- That's what I'm talking about.
- I got you on this one.

1491
01:24:33,077 --> 01:24:34,208
All right. Let's go,
let's go.

1492
01:24:34,210 --> 01:24:36,108
- Hey, sissy.
- Thank you, thank you.

1493
01:24:36,110 --> 01:24:38,244
- Hey, Melinda.
- Where you been?

1494
01:24:39,776 --> 01:24:40,841
You're late, babe.

1495
01:24:40,843 --> 01:24:42,944
- What's up, Mel?
- Yeah, I know.

1496
01:24:44,875 --> 01:24:47,241
- Did Robert give you this?
- Yeah.

1497
01:24:47,243 --> 01:24:49,707
Along with these keys

1498
01:24:49,709 --> 01:24:51,874
and the deed to
Mama's house.

1499
01:24:51,876 --> 01:24:53,441
What?

1500
01:24:53,443 --> 01:24:55,207
Yeah, his battery hit.

1501
01:24:55,209 --> 01:24:57,044
He's in business with Prescott.

1502
01:24:59,709 --> 01:25:01,340
I'm calling the bank
first thing in the morning.

1503
01:25:01,342 --> 01:25:04,110
I already did, and it's good.

1504
01:25:05,176 --> 01:25:06,707
Damn.

1505
01:25:06,709 --> 01:25:08,442
He hit like this?

1506
01:25:08,444 --> 01:25:12,308
I knew he would.
That dude is smart.

1507
01:25:12,310 --> 01:25:13,644
Mel, when did you see him?

1508
01:25:14,910 --> 01:25:16,840
He came to my job
to tell me he was sorry,

1509
01:25:16,842 --> 01:25:20,343
and that he loved me,
and he wanted to give me that.

1510
01:25:20,910 --> 01:25:22,840
Oh, my God.

1511
01:25:22,842 --> 01:25:25,907
That is so sweet. We ain't
never had this kind of money.

1512
01:25:25,909 --> 01:25:27,010
Wow.

1513
01:25:28,010 --> 01:25:29,677
He really did it.

1514
01:25:30,476 --> 01:25:32,208
Well,

1515
01:25:32,210 --> 01:25:34,011
you always thought he would.

1516
01:25:35,010 --> 01:25:37,408
Ten million dollars.

1517
01:25:37,410 --> 01:25:39,074
Hell, go cash this before he
changes his mind or something.

1518
01:25:39,076 --> 01:25:40,442
He won't.

1519
01:25:40,444 --> 01:25:42,107
Well, let's not take
no chances.

1520
01:25:42,109 --> 01:25:43,741
Let's go to the bank
first thing in the morning.

1521
01:25:43,743 --> 01:25:45,774
That bastard might have
a change of heart or something.

1522
01:25:45,776 --> 01:25:46,977
Shut the fuck up.

1523
01:25:48,377 --> 01:25:50,176
Why did I listen to you?

1524
01:25:51,875 --> 01:25:54,441
I mean, both of you are
some miserable bitches.

1525
01:25:54,443 --> 01:25:56,741
Neither one of you are happy
with these bastards,

1526
01:25:56,743 --> 01:25:58,375
and I listened to you.

1527
01:25:58,377 --> 01:25:59,841
Now you just wait one minute.

1528
01:25:59,843 --> 01:26:01,707
No, no.

1529
01:26:01,709 --> 01:26:06,808
Everybody in this town knows
Kalvin has a baby in Ellenwood.

1530
01:26:06,810 --> 01:26:10,375
And well, Casey, you know
what they say about you.

1531
01:26:10,377 --> 01:26:11,408
Melinda!

1532
01:26:11,410 --> 01:26:15,741
Devon, you should go home
and never call me again.

1533
01:26:15,743 --> 01:26:18,108
You are horrible in bed.

1534
01:26:18,110 --> 01:26:19,707
You snore,

1535
01:26:19,709 --> 01:26:23,244
and you are too big
to have such a little dick.

1536
01:26:25,342 --> 01:26:27,276
Fucking shit.

1537
01:26:41,376 --> 01:26:42,644
Hold on.

1538
01:26:51,810 --> 01:26:53,341
Hi.

1539
01:26:53,343 --> 01:26:55,409
The address was
on the check.

1540
01:26:56,975 --> 01:26:58,908
Yeah. Yeah.

1541
01:26:58,910 --> 01:27:01,144
And I remembered
the building.

1542
01:27:08,909 --> 01:27:11,044
This is the building you
said we would live in.

1543
01:27:15,109 --> 01:27:17,409
You look great.

1544
01:27:19,310 --> 01:27:20,710
Thank you.

1545
01:27:22,110 --> 01:27:24,177
And this view...

1546
01:27:26,177 --> 01:27:27,177
Oh!

1547
01:27:27,775 --> 01:27:29,111
This view!

1548
01:27:33,176 --> 01:27:34,643
Top floor.

1549
01:27:35,409 --> 01:27:37,410
You said the top floor.

1550
01:27:38,742 --> 01:27:40,274
Out of your dreams.

1551
01:27:40,276 --> 01:27:43,677
This is just like everything
you described to me.

1552
01:27:44,842 --> 01:27:46,809
I'm so proud of you.

1553
01:27:48,743 --> 01:27:50,141
Thank you.

1554
01:27:50,143 --> 01:27:53,175
And when you said
you loved me,

1555
01:27:53,177 --> 01:27:57,177
I realized I still love
you very, very much.

1556
01:28:00,077 --> 01:28:02,707
And I should have
believed you

1557
01:28:02,709 --> 01:28:04,841
when you said you
weren't with her.

1558
01:28:04,843 --> 01:28:08,441
But my sisters, my sisters.
They got in my head.

1559
01:28:08,443 --> 01:28:10,373
That's all behind
us now, Mel.

1560
01:28:10,375 --> 01:28:11,810
I'm so glad
you said that.

1561
01:28:15,810 --> 01:28:17,043
Sorry I'm late, babe.

1562
01:28:25,876 --> 01:28:27,873
Hey...

1563
01:28:27,875 --> 01:28:30,643
Baby, this is Melinda,
my ex-wife.

1564
01:28:33,409 --> 01:28:35,075
Hi.

1565
01:28:35,077 --> 01:28:38,741
I'm Diana.
I'm Robert's fiancee.

1566
01:28:38,743 --> 01:28:40,377
<i>There she was.</i>

1567
01:28:41,910 --> 01:28:45,040
<i>The bitch I tried to kill
all those years ago</i>

1568
01:28:45,042 --> 01:28:48,241
<i>standing in my apartment,</i>

1569
01:28:48,243 --> 01:28:50,211
<i>wearing my ring.</i>

1570
01:28:51,209 --> 01:28:52,777
<i>Looking at me.</i>

1571
01:29:06,341 --> 01:29:11,908
<i>That son of a bitch humiliated me
again in front of that same whore.</i>

1572
01:29:11,910 --> 01:29:13,407
<i>I can't believe he let me
pour my heart out</i>

1573
01:29:13,409 --> 01:29:15,740
<i>and she was in there
all that time.</i>

1574
01:29:15,742 --> 01:29:19,040
<i>This bitch was living my life.</i>

1575
01:29:19,042 --> 01:29:22,074
<i>The one I bought and paid for.</i>

1576
01:29:22,076 --> 01:29:24,406
<i>He would always like
to do it in the shower</i>

1577
01:29:24,408 --> 01:29:28,274
<i>because he said it reminded him
of us when we met in the rain.</i>

1578
01:29:28,276 --> 01:29:30,808
<i>You see why I hate the rain?</i>

1579
01:29:30,810 --> 01:29:34,211
<i>I'm sure he was with that bitch
in the shower.</i>

1580
01:29:35,177 --> 01:29:37,043
<i>That was supposed to be mine.</i>

1581
01:29:38,375 --> 01:29:39,976
<i>Tasting her.</i>

1582
01:29:43,942 --> 01:29:44,944
<i>Fucking her.</i>

1583
01:29:49,743 --> 01:29:51,310
<i>Using what I taught him.</i>

1584
01:29:52,176 --> 01:29:54,810
<i>Using my tricks on that trick.</i>

1585
01:29:57,241 --> 01:30:00,708
<i>And I know Nina
was somewhere close.</i>

1586
01:30:06,810 --> 01:30:09,373
<i>By now, Robert was
spooning her, I'm sure.</i>

1587
01:30:09,375 --> 01:30:12,708
<i>Breathing ever so slightly
on the back of her neck.</i>

1588
01:30:12,710 --> 01:30:14,774
<i>I can still smell
the slightest hint of whiskey</i>

1589
01:30:14,776 --> 01:30:16,140
<i>on his breath.</i>

1590
01:30:16,142 --> 01:30:18,076
<i>I can feel it on my neck.</i>

1591
01:30:18,910 --> 01:30:20,108
<i>Bitch!</i>

1592
01:30:20,110 --> 01:30:22,841
<i>And she just moved in?</i>

1593
01:30:22,843 --> 01:30:25,041
<i>No. I don't think so.</i>

1594
01:30:25,043 --> 01:30:27,141
<i>I put every jewel
in that crown,</i>

1595
01:30:27,143 --> 01:30:30,044
<i>and I was not about to let
another bitch wear it!</i>

1596
01:30:40,276 --> 01:30:42,007
<i>I couldn't believe it.</i>

1597
01:30:42,009 --> 01:30:45,040
<i>He could just leave
and walk away.</i>

1598
01:30:45,042 --> 01:30:46,108
<i>He said he loved me,</i>

1599
01:30:46,110 --> 01:30:49,973
<i>but he moved her into my place
like I never existed.</i>

1600
01:30:49,975 --> 01:30:52,741
<i>I couldn't eat.
I couldn't sleep.</i>

1601
01:30:52,743 --> 01:30:56,874
<i>All I did was think
about him and her.</i>

1602
01:30:56,876 --> 01:30:58,173
<i>I had alerts
on everything I owned.</i>

1603
01:30:58,175 --> 01:31:01,175
<i>Every time that bitch posted
something, I knew it.</i>

1604
01:31:03,710 --> 01:31:06,339
<i>And you know what?
Everything he said to me.</i>

1605
01:31:06,341 --> 01:31:10,973
<i>He would take me to Paris,
and there they were in Paris.</i>

1606
01:31:10,975 --> 01:31:13,840
<i>He said he would take me
on our private jet.</i>

1607
01:31:13,842 --> 01:31:15,275
<i>And there they were.</i>

1608
01:31:16,910 --> 01:31:19,773
<i>Day and night,
I just watched her page.</i>

1609
01:31:19,775 --> 01:31:21,707
<i>I couldn't help it.</i>

1610
01:31:21,709 --> 01:31:23,973
<i>Her wedding ideas. And her.</i>

1611
01:31:23,975 --> 01:31:26,306
<i>She even chose a dress
by the same designer</i>

1612
01:31:26,308 --> 01:31:28,041
<i>that I wanted to make mine.</i>

1613
01:31:28,043 --> 01:31:29,807
<i>At the same boutique.</i>

1614
01:31:29,809 --> 01:31:31,306
- <i>I got you.</i>
- <i>Babe...</i>

1615
01:31:31,308 --> 01:31:33,774
- <i>I will not let go of you.</i>
- <i>Okay.</i>

1616
01:31:33,776 --> 01:31:36,011
<i>Walking. So get ready...</i>

1617
01:31:36,909 --> 01:31:38,142
<i>Okay.</i>

1618
01:31:38,875 --> 01:31:40,840
<i>Not yet.</i>

1619
01:31:40,842 --> 01:31:42,941
- <i>Come on.</i>
- <i>No, just... Right there.</i>

1620
01:31:42,943 --> 01:31:44,011
<i>All right.</i>

1621
01:31:44,976 --> 01:31:46,406
<i>Can I open?</i>

1622
01:31:46,408 --> 01:31:47,809
<i>Open them now.</i>

1623
01:31:49,775 --> 01:31:51,374
<i>Look behind you.</i>

1624
01:31:51,376 --> 01:31:52,841
<i>Surprise.</i>

1625
01:31:52,843 --> 01:31:55,077
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

1626
01:31:57,241 --> 01:31:59,174
Mrs. Gayle.

1627
01:31:59,176 --> 01:32:01,677
<i>I told you I would
buy it for you.</i>

1628
01:32:21,909 --> 01:32:24,041
- I love this, I love this!
- Mmm.

1629
01:32:24,043 --> 01:32:26,273
Oh, my God. I like this,
but in white.

1630
01:32:26,275 --> 01:32:27,339
- Hmm.
- Yeah?

1631
01:32:27,341 --> 01:32:28,774
How about this one?

1632
01:32:28,776 --> 01:32:30,307
As you're waving
goodbye to your guests.

1633
01:32:30,309 --> 01:32:32,940
Perfect! I love it.
They're gonna love it!

1634
01:32:32,942 --> 01:32:34,175
Hi, John.

1635
01:32:35,042 --> 01:32:37,140
Hey, babe.
Look at this.

1636
01:32:37,142 --> 01:32:40,740
Okay, what do you think about this with
the bon voyage and I wave goodbye?

1637
01:32:40,742 --> 01:32:42,107
- It's beautiful.
- Right? Ain't it pretty?

1638
01:32:42,109 --> 01:32:43,206
Listen, baby,
can I talk to you?

1639
01:32:43,208 --> 01:32:45,173
Yeah, sure.

1640
01:32:45,175 --> 01:32:48,307
Okay, well, John, we'll talk
more about the wedding tomorrow?

1641
01:32:48,309 --> 01:32:49,473
Some other time? Okay.

1642
01:32:49,475 --> 01:32:50,977
- Okay, thank you.
- Thanks, John.

1643
01:32:54,142 --> 01:32:55,175
What's...

1644
01:32:56,075 --> 01:32:57,809
Melinda, she's...

1645
01:32:58,408 --> 01:32:59,641
She's suing us.

1646
01:32:59,643 --> 01:33:03,440
She's claiming that the deal
happened before the divorce.

1647
01:33:03,442 --> 01:33:05,808
We both know
that's not true.

1648
01:33:05,810 --> 01:33:08,309
Yeah, I know.
It's just so sad.

1649
01:33:09,308 --> 01:33:11,807
Yeah, I'm gonna
call Franklin.

1650
01:33:11,809 --> 01:33:14,275
Yeah, I already talked to
him this morning about her.

1651
01:33:15,176 --> 01:33:16,941
What? Why?

1652
01:33:16,943 --> 01:33:19,006
I didn't wanna tell you,
but I received, like,

1653
01:33:19,008 --> 01:33:22,140
3,300 nasty comments from
somebody named Pissed.

1654
01:33:22,142 --> 01:33:23,874
And, of course,
it's Melinda.

1655
01:33:23,876 --> 01:33:24,973
I'll talk to her.

1656
01:33:24,975 --> 01:33:26,474
- No. No.
- Maybe I can give her

1657
01:33:26,476 --> 01:33:29,777
- more money.
- It's not about the money.

1658
01:33:31,142 --> 01:33:33,210
You cannot negotiate
with crazy.

1659
01:33:34,209 --> 01:33:36,075
- It'll be okay.
- Yeah.

1660
01:33:42,042 --> 01:33:43,143
Mel?

1661
01:33:44,241 --> 01:33:45,840
- Mel?
- Hey, Sarah!

1662
01:33:45,842 --> 01:33:47,007
- Hey.
- Hey.

1663
01:33:47,009 --> 01:33:48,807
Look, she's not
calling us.

1664
01:33:48,809 --> 01:33:50,006
I don't think
we should be here.

1665
01:33:50,008 --> 01:33:51,607
Something's wrong.

1666
01:33:51,609 --> 01:33:54,907
Guys, I don't think it's a good
idea for us to go in there. Come on!

1667
01:33:54,909 --> 01:33:56,910
Where are you going? What is...

1668
01:34:00,041 --> 01:34:02,039
It is still that easy
to get in here?

1669
01:34:02,041 --> 01:34:03,907
Melinda?

1670
01:34:03,909 --> 01:34:06,009
- Melinda?
- Melinda?

1671
01:34:07,442 --> 01:34:09,173
Melinda, where are you?

1672
01:34:09,175 --> 01:34:10,676
Mel?

1673
01:34:12,876 --> 01:34:15,074
What is going...

1674
01:34:15,076 --> 01:34:16,410
- What the hell is all this?
- What?

1675
01:34:19,041 --> 01:34:20,707
Oh, my God.

1676
01:34:20,709 --> 01:34:23,774
Oh, my God. What is...

1677
01:34:23,776 --> 01:34:26,473
We're certain he made the deal with
Prescott and Howard Industries

1678
01:34:26,475 --> 01:34:29,107
while he was still married
to my client, Your Honor.

1679
01:34:29,109 --> 01:34:31,040
He also received
all the investments

1680
01:34:31,042 --> 01:34:34,206
for the Gayle Force Battery
from my client's income alone.

1681
01:34:34,208 --> 01:34:37,173
And the mortgage from the
family house, which she lost.

1682
01:34:37,175 --> 01:34:40,708
Counselor, I'm looking at all
the dates on these contracts

1683
01:34:40,710 --> 01:34:42,207
and the email chains.

1684
01:34:42,209 --> 01:34:45,039
And an affidavit from
Prescott and Howard Industries.

1685
01:34:45,041 --> 01:34:47,207
They attest that the deal
wasn't offered

1686
01:34:47,209 --> 01:34:50,210
until well after Mr. Gayle
and your client were divorced.

1687
01:34:52,476 --> 01:34:55,474
And seeing as he didn't ask
for the divorce, she did,

1688
01:34:55,476 --> 01:34:57,307
I'm confused.

1689
01:34:57,309 --> 01:35:00,173
- Well, Your Honor...
- I'm not done.

1690
01:35:00,175 --> 01:35:05,073
After the divorce, he gave your client
10 million dollars voluntarily.

1691
01:35:05,075 --> 01:35:09,173
And then he rebought the family house and gave that to her.

1692
01:35:09,175 --> 01:35:10,940
Is that right?

1693
01:35:10,942 --> 01:35:11,906
Yes, Your Honor.

1694
01:35:11,908 --> 01:35:14,840
And how much are you claiming
for damages?

1695
01:35:14,842 --> 01:35:17,239
Well, she invested over
1.2 million dollars

1696
01:35:17,241 --> 01:35:18,674
over the course
of their marriage.

1697
01:35:18,676 --> 01:35:22,239
And we're asking for half the
value of the Gayle Force Battery,

1698
01:35:22,241 --> 01:35:25,473
which deems to exceed approximately
150 million dollars.

1699
01:35:25,475 --> 01:35:29,074
Okay, enough.
That's ridiculous.

1700
01:35:29,076 --> 01:35:33,873
It is apparent to the court that Mr.
Gayle has been more than fair.

1701
01:35:33,875 --> 01:35:35,440
I'm going to dismiss this case.

1702
01:35:35,442 --> 01:35:37,307
This is not fair.

1703
01:35:37,309 --> 01:35:40,140
I should get half of what he got.
That is fair.

1704
01:35:40,142 --> 01:35:42,206
Listen.
This court has spoken.

1705
01:35:42,208 --> 01:35:46,374
Don't you understand that he
didn't have to give you anything?

1706
01:35:46,376 --> 01:35:49,939
This is one of the most generous
gestures this court has ever seen.

1707
01:35:49,941 --> 01:35:53,106
This case is dismissed.

1708
01:35:53,108 --> 01:35:56,206
Also, Your Honor, there's
another matter on the docket.

1709
01:35:56,208 --> 01:35:59,808
Mrs. Moore has been harassing
the future Mrs. Gayle.

1710
01:35:59,810 --> 01:36:02,774
You'll see all the evidence
presented there in front of you.

1711
01:36:02,776 --> 01:36:06,074
We're asking for a restraining
order for both Mr. and Mrs. Gayle.

1712
01:36:06,076 --> 01:36:07,973
I'm the one who should get
the damn restraining order.

1713
01:36:07,975 --> 01:36:10,473
- Counselor, control your client!
- Melinda.

1714
01:36:10,475 --> 01:36:13,972
I don't need to be controlled.
I'm not an animal.

1715
01:36:13,974 --> 01:36:16,142
Did you send these messages?

1716
01:36:17,242 --> 01:36:18,743
This is America.

1717
01:36:19,376 --> 01:36:21,340
I have freedom of speech.

1718
01:36:21,342 --> 01:36:22,307
These are threats.

1719
01:36:22,309 --> 01:36:25,306
You could spend time in jail,
Mrs. Moore.

1720
01:36:25,308 --> 01:36:27,339
Do it again, and you will.

1721
01:36:27,341 --> 01:36:29,009
Restraining order is granted.

1722
01:36:30,375 --> 01:36:32,206
Mrs. Moore,

1723
01:36:32,208 --> 01:36:35,940
you are to stay 300 yards away
from Mr. and Mrs. Gayle.

1724
01:36:35,942 --> 01:36:38,407
- Do you understand?
- They're not married.

1725
01:36:38,409 --> 01:36:40,940
Stay away from both of them.

1726
01:36:40,942 --> 01:36:42,343
Is that clear enough for you?

1727
01:36:43,008 --> 01:36:44,042
Yes.

1728
01:36:51,142 --> 01:36:52,377
Wait, go!

1729
01:36:53,008 --> 01:36:54,139
Melinda!

1730
01:36:54,141 --> 01:36:55,440
- Go!
- Mel, don't!

1731
01:36:55,442 --> 01:36:57,707
- I'm okay, I'm okay.
- Stop, stop, stop.

1732
01:36:57,709 --> 01:36:59,274
Let them go.

1733
01:36:59,276 --> 01:37:01,407
- Melinda, no.
- Melinda!

1734
01:37:01,409 --> 01:37:05,776
This is Melinda, and I
am live on the Internet.

1735
01:37:06,975 --> 01:37:09,007
<i>I want you to see this
injustice.</i>

1736
01:37:09,009 --> 01:37:12,772
<i>This whore slept
with my husband.</i>

1737
01:37:12,774 --> 01:37:14,872
<i>And he left me with nothing...</i>

1738
01:37:14,874 --> 01:37:16,473
- Stop it now. Please stop.
- Enough, enough!

1739
01:37:16,475 --> 01:37:17,806
Please stop!

1740
01:37:17,808 --> 01:37:19,340
Mel, it's not healthy.
I'm serious.

1741
01:37:19,342 --> 01:37:21,906
You have to stop the way
you're dealing with him.

1742
01:37:21,908 --> 01:37:23,707
I don't want to talk
about him.

1743
01:37:23,709 --> 01:37:25,240
Fine, we won't. We'll
talk about your sisters,

1744
01:37:25,242 --> 01:37:27,239
and how they love you, and
they're worried about you.

1745
01:37:27,241 --> 01:37:28,440
And so am I.

1746
01:37:28,442 --> 01:37:30,074
That stuff that
we found in your house.

1747
01:37:30,076 --> 01:37:31,210
- It was...
- Wait.

1748
01:37:32,742 --> 01:37:34,210
You went to my house?

1749
01:37:35,309 --> 01:37:36,240
Yeah.

1750
01:37:36,242 --> 01:37:37,939
Y'all motherfuckers
don't wanna help me.

1751
01:37:37,941 --> 01:37:39,441
Come back with me,
so we can talk about it.

1752
01:37:39,443 --> 01:37:41,207
- Melinda, just...
- No, I see what's going on.

1753
01:37:41,209 --> 01:37:43,273
- Melinda?
- Fuck that!

1754
01:37:43,275 --> 01:37:44,808
I'm going to June's.

1755
01:37:52,176 --> 01:37:53,776
Thank you, guys,
for coming.

1756
01:37:54,808 --> 01:37:57,473
Look, we're worried
about Melinda.

1757
01:37:57,475 --> 01:37:59,973
She has really lost it
over you two.

1758
01:37:59,975 --> 01:38:03,106
Now we're gonna try to get a judge
to force her and get some help.

1759
01:38:03,108 --> 01:38:04,373
That might be
a good idea.

1760
01:38:04,375 --> 01:38:06,873
But in the meantime,
you need to be careful.

1761
01:38:06,875 --> 01:38:07,939
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1762
01:38:07,941 --> 01:38:08,943
Both of you do.

1763
01:38:10,275 --> 01:38:12,739
We have the
restraining order.

1764
01:38:12,741 --> 01:38:14,807
You guys might wanna have
security at the wedding.

1765
01:38:14,809 --> 01:38:16,707
- Yeah.
- Seriously.

1766
01:38:16,709 --> 01:38:17,906
Look, guys,

1767
01:38:17,908 --> 01:38:19,940
I know she's upset.

1768
01:38:19,942 --> 01:38:21,907
Like you said,
I know your sister.

1769
01:38:21,909 --> 01:38:23,906
She'll be fine once
she calms down.

1770
01:38:23,908 --> 01:38:26,708
If you think that,
you don't know her at all.

1771
01:38:29,076 --> 01:38:30,373
Oh, my God.
No, no, no.

1772
01:38:30,375 --> 01:38:32,174
You two, you cannot be
here right now.

1773
01:38:32,176 --> 01:38:34,739
- She's right behind me.
- Oh, shit.

1774
01:38:34,741 --> 01:38:37,273
Why the fuck are y'all
still coming in my house

1775
01:38:37,275 --> 01:38:39,740
- without my permission?
- Sweetie.

1776
01:38:39,742 --> 01:38:40,973
So what y'all
been doing?

1777
01:38:40,975 --> 01:38:43,840
- Talking about me behind my back?
- Melinda.

1778
01:38:43,842 --> 01:38:45,139
- Go!
- And that's why you brought her here?

1779
01:38:45,141 --> 01:38:46,206
No! No!

1780
01:38:46,208 --> 01:38:48,807
- Let me talk to her!
- No!

1781
01:38:48,809 --> 01:38:51,007
Y'all have to hold me
back! No!

1782
01:38:51,009 --> 01:38:53,373
I need that bitch
to know that's my car!

1783
01:38:53,375 --> 01:38:55,339
Why would you
bring her here, Robert?

1784
01:38:55,341 --> 01:38:57,306
That's my car, bitch!

1785
01:38:57,308 --> 01:38:58,807
It's not worth it, honey.

1786
01:38:58,809 --> 01:39:00,773
- That's my car!
- No! No!

1787
01:39:00,775 --> 01:39:03,074
- Go!
- Get off of me!

1788
01:39:03,076 --> 01:39:05,676
I'm okay. All right! Okay!

1789
01:39:08,242 --> 01:39:09,840
I'm okay.

1790
01:39:09,842 --> 01:39:11,909
I'm okay. I'm okay.

1791
01:39:13,009 --> 01:39:14,840
Stop treating me like this.

1792
01:39:14,842 --> 01:39:17,139
Why would you let him
bring her here?

1793
01:39:17,141 --> 01:39:20,407
So disrespectful! What kind
of family are you, huh?

1794
01:39:20,409 --> 01:39:21,743
What about me?

1795
01:39:22,443 --> 01:39:24,276
- God!
- Melinda!

1796
01:39:25,908 --> 01:39:27,708
Melinda!

1797
01:39:57,309 --> 01:39:59,106
Hi, may I help you?

1798
01:39:59,108 --> 01:40:00,842
No, I'm just looking.

1799
01:40:01,208 --> 01:40:02,376
Thank you.

1800
01:40:05,841 --> 01:40:06,843
Here we go.

1801
01:40:08,775 --> 01:40:09,906
It's really lovely.

1802
01:40:09,908 --> 01:40:11,775
Yeah, I love
the buttons.

1803
01:41:01,009 --> 01:41:02,308
Hey, wait!

1804
01:41:02,310 --> 01:41:05,074
And she ruined the future Mrs.
Gayle's wedding dress.

1805
01:41:05,076 --> 01:41:06,939
This court
apologizes to you.

1806
01:41:06,941 --> 01:41:08,740
I shouldn't have
been so lenient.

1807
01:41:08,742 --> 01:41:09,972
It's okay, Your Honor.

1808
01:41:09,974 --> 01:41:12,006
I couldn't fit the dress
anymore anyway.

1809
01:41:12,008 --> 01:41:14,042
This little one's
growing pretty fast.

1810
01:41:16,809 --> 01:41:21,174
What is it going to take to make
you heed the warnings of this court?

1811
01:41:21,176 --> 01:41:25,441
It's obvious to me that you're not
taking this matter seriously.

1812
01:41:25,443 --> 01:41:28,808
I will not allow you to continue
to harass these people.

1813
01:41:29,442 --> 01:41:31,206
Am I clear?

1814
01:41:31,208 --> 01:41:33,973
If you violate
this restraining order,

1815
01:41:33,975 --> 01:41:37,175
I assure you, you will spend
40 days in the county jail.

1816
01:41:37,741 --> 01:41:38,807
I mean it.

1817
01:41:38,809 --> 01:41:40,940
One more offense.

1818
01:41:40,942 --> 01:41:43,310
Do I make myself clear?

1819
01:41:48,475 --> 01:41:49,942
Yes, Your Honor.

1820
01:41:51,409 --> 01:41:53,441
<i>Melinda.</i>

1821
01:41:53,443 --> 01:41:57,406
Have you ever considered that maybe
there's another way to look at this?

1822
01:41:57,408 --> 01:41:59,908
Maybe he did mean
what he said.

1823
01:42:01,042 --> 01:42:04,440
Maybe the deceit
isn't what you think.

1824
01:42:04,442 --> 01:42:07,907
Would you allow room
for that possibility?

1825
01:42:07,909 --> 01:42:11,240
Would you feel better
if he was really being honest

1826
01:42:11,242 --> 01:42:13,242
and he really meant well?

1827
01:42:16,443 --> 01:42:19,243
I am not wrong.

1828
01:42:20,974 --> 01:42:22,908
You're just like
everybody else.

1829
01:42:24,242 --> 01:42:25,809
See...

1830
01:42:27,308 --> 01:42:29,273
I get dogged,

1831
01:42:29,275 --> 01:42:31,840
and it's my fault.

1832
01:42:31,842 --> 01:42:33,174
That's not
what I'm saying.

1833
01:42:33,176 --> 01:42:34,240
That's what you're saying.

1834
01:42:34,242 --> 01:42:38,007
I just wanted to know
if you would consider it.

1835
01:42:38,009 --> 01:42:39,707
Let me ask you
another question.

1836
01:42:39,709 --> 01:42:40,709
Okay.

1837
01:42:42,208 --> 01:42:43,406
Have you ever
heard of something

1838
01:42:43,408 --> 01:42:46,972
called Borderline
Personality Disorder?

1839
01:42:46,974 --> 01:42:49,140
It's when a person has...

1840
01:42:49,142 --> 01:42:50,643
You know what?

1841
01:42:51,709 --> 01:42:53,872
I'm not doing this.

1842
01:42:53,874 --> 01:42:57,074
Fuck you and this bullshit.

1843
01:42:57,076 --> 01:42:58,776
I'm not crazy.

1844
01:42:59,141 --> 01:43:00,275
What?

1845
01:43:01,341 --> 01:43:03,409
Get out of here
with this bullshit.

1846
01:43:04,742 --> 01:43:08,110
As a matter of fact, I'm out.

1847
01:43:08,942 --> 01:43:10,872
We are gathered here...

1848
01:43:10,874 --> 01:43:14,207
<i>That bitch wasted
no time taking over my life.</i>

1849
01:43:14,209 --> 01:43:18,007
<i>I just can't believe
Robert married that whore</i>

1850
01:43:18,009 --> 01:43:21,043
<i>and gave her my boat. My boat!</i>

1851
01:43:21,942 --> 01:43:23,709
<i>The boat with my name on it.</i>

1852
01:43:24,342 --> 01:43:25,775
<i>She was living my life.</i>

1853
01:43:29,108 --> 01:43:30,275
<i>Fuck her.</i>

1854
01:43:31,176 --> 01:43:32,643
<i>Fuck him.</i>

1855
01:43:33,076 --> 01:43:34,776
<i>Fuck them both.</i>

1856
01:43:39,075 --> 01:43:40,405
Hey.

1857
01:44:13,209 --> 01:44:14,342
Melinda?

1858
01:44:16,042 --> 01:44:17,176
Melinda?

1859
01:44:35,441 --> 01:44:37,075
It's a beautiful night.

1860
01:44:38,208 --> 01:44:39,375
Mmm-hmm.

1861
01:44:39,875 --> 01:44:41,406
Mmm-hmm.

1862
01:44:41,408 --> 01:44:42,409
I love you.

1863
01:44:45,209 --> 01:44:46,876
Look at those stars.

1864
01:44:49,408 --> 01:44:51,706
You're that one.
What are you doing?

1865
01:44:51,708 --> 01:44:53,338
I meant to start a bath.

1866
01:44:53,340 --> 01:44:54,438
Let the staff do it.

1867
01:44:54,440 --> 01:44:57,642
No, no. I need to get up.
I need to get sea legs.

1868
01:44:59,176 --> 01:45:00,775
You wanna join me
in a few?

1869
01:45:02,408 --> 01:45:03,809
You know it.

1870
01:45:07,909 --> 01:45:08,909
See you.

1871
01:45:47,408 --> 01:45:48,939
Where's my wedding dress?

1872
01:45:48,941 --> 01:45:50,839
It was hanging
in the closet, ma'am.

1873
01:45:50,841 --> 01:45:51,907
I didn't see it.

1874
01:45:51,909 --> 01:45:53,339
I'll check with
housekeeping.

1875
01:45:53,341 --> 01:45:54,643
Okay.

1876
01:46:17,375 --> 01:46:18,840
The bath is ready already?

1877
01:46:18,842 --> 01:46:20,142
No.

1878
01:46:20,942 --> 01:46:22,238
Sit down.

1879
01:46:22,240 --> 01:46:23,241
Mel.

1880
01:46:24,274 --> 01:46:25,972
What are you doing?

1881
01:46:25,974 --> 01:46:27,808
What are you doing?

1882
01:46:28,874 --> 01:46:30,906
What are you doing, Robert?

1883
01:46:30,908 --> 01:46:33,305
- Come on, Mel, you know this is not right.
- No.

1884
01:46:33,307 --> 01:46:36,241
What's not right is
what you did to me.

1885
01:46:37,008 --> 01:46:38,239
What did I do?

1886
01:46:38,241 --> 01:46:40,140
Don't act like
you don't remember.

1887
01:46:40,142 --> 01:46:42,142
Okay, okay, okay.

1888
01:46:43,742 --> 01:46:45,773
Tell me so that I'm sure.

1889
01:46:45,775 --> 01:46:47,706
You left me.

1890
01:46:47,708 --> 01:46:50,406
You took the best parts
of my life.

1891
01:46:50,408 --> 01:46:52,643
And you gave that bitch my ring,

1892
01:46:53,275 --> 01:46:54,808
my apartment,

1893
01:46:55,708 --> 01:46:56,842
my boat,

1894
01:46:57,340 --> 01:46:59,238
my life.

1895
01:46:59,240 --> 01:47:02,707
And you promised those things to me.
Didn't you, Robert?

1896
01:47:02,709 --> 01:47:03,840
Didn't you?

1897
01:47:03,842 --> 01:47:05,173
I did, I did.

1898
01:47:05,175 --> 01:47:06,274
I did.

1899
01:47:07,808 --> 01:47:08,809
I did.

1900
01:47:09,875 --> 01:47:13,205
So why...
Why did you give it to her?

1901
01:47:13,207 --> 01:47:14,776
Mel, you divorced me.

1902
01:47:15,375 --> 01:47:16,473
You left me!

1903
01:47:16,475 --> 01:47:18,740
You didn't fight.

1904
01:47:18,742 --> 01:47:20,007
- You didn't fight.
- Mel.

1905
01:47:20,009 --> 01:47:24,140
No, you used me to work and take
care of you until you made it.

1906
01:47:24,142 --> 01:47:25,238
You never loved me.

1907
01:47:25,240 --> 01:47:28,074
- Mel, that's not true. I loved you.
- Then why?

1908
01:47:28,076 --> 01:47:30,409
Why did you give it
all to her, huh?

1909
01:47:32,109 --> 01:47:35,339
Why are you here
with her and not me?

1910
01:47:35,341 --> 01:47:37,873
You promised me forever.

1911
01:47:37,875 --> 01:47:40,440
You promised me forever
and she was there all the time.

1912
01:47:40,442 --> 01:47:43,039
No, no. That is not
true, Mel.

1913
01:47:43,041 --> 01:47:45,006
I never cheated on you.

1914
01:47:45,008 --> 01:47:46,205
Then why?

1915
01:47:46,207 --> 01:47:48,141
I never cheated
on you, Mel.

1916
01:47:48,809 --> 01:47:49,842
Never!

1917
01:47:50,875 --> 01:47:52,142
I love you.

1918
01:47:55,241 --> 01:47:56,943
I always will.

1919
01:47:58,708 --> 01:47:59,709
Good.

1920
01:48:00,709 --> 01:48:02,205
Then make her
jump off the boat.

1921
01:48:02,207 --> 01:48:03,873
- Mel, Mel.
- Come on.

1922
01:48:03,875 --> 01:48:05,406
So we can start
our life together.

1923
01:48:05,408 --> 01:48:06,840
No, come on, get up.
Let's go get her.

1924
01:48:06,842 --> 01:48:07,973
No, Mel, Mel.

1925
01:48:07,975 --> 01:48:09,306
Get up!

1926
01:48:09,308 --> 01:48:11,876
Listen, let's just talk
about this, okay?

1927
01:48:12,442 --> 01:48:13,773
Come on.

1928
01:48:13,775 --> 01:48:15,439
Give me the gun.

1929
01:48:15,441 --> 01:48:16,973
Just give me the gun.

1930
01:48:20,341 --> 01:48:22,105
- I heard a shot!
- It came from up top!

1931
01:48:22,107 --> 01:48:23,109
What's going on?

1932
01:48:24,341 --> 01:48:25,342
Jump!

1933
01:48:27,041 --> 01:48:28,105
Jump!

1934
01:48:28,107 --> 01:48:29,740
You better jump!

1935
01:48:50,107 --> 01:48:51,175
Mel,
what are you doing?

1936
01:48:53,308 --> 01:48:54,676
Mel.

1937
01:48:57,442 --> 01:48:59,372
Where are you going, huh?

1938
01:48:59,374 --> 01:49:01,138
Stop, bitch, before
I shoot you in the...

1939
01:49:11,140 --> 01:49:12,275
Give me the ring.

1940
01:49:12,909 --> 01:49:14,039
What ring?

1941
01:49:14,041 --> 01:49:15,676
That ring, bitch!

1942
01:49:16,741 --> 01:49:18,173
Give it to me.

1943
01:49:18,175 --> 01:49:19,873
You bitches
are something.

1944
01:49:19,875 --> 01:49:22,273
The first wife puts in
all the work,

1945
01:49:22,275 --> 01:49:24,707
and you whores
reap the benefits?

1946
01:49:24,709 --> 01:49:26,875
No, ma'am. Give it here.

1947
01:49:27,408 --> 01:49:28,709
Give it to me.

1948
01:49:29,308 --> 01:49:30,342
No!

1949
01:49:31,975 --> 01:49:33,075
Robert!

1950
01:49:35,307 --> 01:49:37,205
I need to stop the boat.

1951
01:49:37,207 --> 01:49:38,776
Okay. Okay.

1952
01:49:50,340 --> 01:49:52,008
Pull the throttle.

1953
01:50:04,207 --> 01:50:05,338
Okay. Are you okay?

1954
01:50:05,340 --> 01:50:06,909
I'm okay. I'm okay.

1955
01:50:07,441 --> 01:50:09,338
Okay, babe.

1956
01:50:09,340 --> 01:50:13,272
I need you to get in the tender,
and I need you to go get the crew.

1957
01:50:13,274 --> 01:50:14,939
The crew?

1958
01:50:14,941 --> 01:50:17,338
She made them jump.

1959
01:50:17,340 --> 01:50:18,940
- Go.
- I'm not leaving you!

1960
01:50:18,942 --> 01:50:21,042
Go, baby.
I'm bleeding out.

1961
01:50:22,075 --> 01:50:23,139
Robert.

1962
01:50:23,141 --> 01:50:24,342
They can help me.

1963
01:50:25,108 --> 01:50:26,109
Go!

1964
01:50:30,108 --> 01:50:31,175
Be careful.

1965
01:50:34,041 --> 01:50:35,807
Hurry, baby.

1966
01:50:35,809 --> 01:50:37,073
Hurry.

1967
01:50:50,874 --> 01:50:52,041
Robert.

1968
01:50:55,808 --> 01:50:57,842
It's all your fault, Robert.

1969
01:51:01,074 --> 01:51:02,675
Now look at you.

1970
01:53:51,622 --> 01:53:56,622
