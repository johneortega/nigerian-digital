what have I done to deserve what you're doing  to me eh each time I put corrective measure  
12:46
you you leveled me a bad man be a bad man  but whatever I do for you yeah I'm asking you
12:56
please please this girl she's been  kneeling Under the Sun for over 30 minutes  
13:03
please that is worrying you or for her to  come out of that kind of behavior or for  
13:10
her to come out from this illicit Association  this never do well she is associating with  
13:19
isn't that bothering you I'm asking you no I  didn't say anything wrong I'm only asking you  
13:26
to forgive her that's all if you played your place  for a good cause I'm not for plead for this hour  
13:32
darling daughter to continue with that boy okay  what have you seen in that voice what does he have
13:43
that kind of a person can be smoking ebook   and affect our daughter with smoking Igbo so maybe  some days if our girl returns from somewhere we  
13:52
perceived smell of people will that be the end  result is it not showing our effort in vain huh
14:02
but I didn't do anything wrong Papa
14:08
you're calling me a fool that he didn't do  anything we observe you've been doing something  
14:21
wrong as our daughter and we are trying to get you  out of it that Quagmire you're saying is indulated  
14:29
that that means the way  where we are foolish people you're compounding the assessment that you're  not your child well you are doing what a child  
14:46
should not do eh okay all your mess are married  if they are married you want to rush marriage  
14:53
and meet Waterloo and meet somebody who who can  bring up a case that police will come and arrest  
15:00
him arrest you you see you see how your argument  is going we wrap stuff for any intelligence eh
15:11
you see you what what what do you  want me to do I have lamented enough  
15:18
I've been pained enough because of the  attitude can you come out from this point
15:26
the way you act towards me even though he's  asking you don't want me to get married in  
15:41
this life but why doesn't you hate me so much  Papa and I don't even know why but why do you  
15:47
face me it is the case because I love you I don't  hurt you in the course of loving you I want you to  
15:55
also go to a man who truly loves you who is not a  criminal because a criminal cannot love somebody  
16:04
from the heart a criminal the scariest way along  when he wants to commit a crime he carries your  
16:11
life so whenever he is caught you will be involved  that's my fight to bring you out of this boy bring  
16:18
her from the bus so you can have rest of mine  that is just that what are you doing there
16:27
they love each other just I love them look at the  word you're using you why well know that that boy  
16:35
is not a good person this is if you look at him  on the surface he's a criminal you're now saying  
16:43
leave the two of them okay this one is striking  fear in me that if you get married you get married  
16:51
why do you all love things that are criminal  people who smoke people people who sleep outside
17:00
is that the argument you're making I'm suspecting  all of you me to leave them to go on come on
17:20
that's what it means
17:43
yeah have you been a long time so something  like two days now I've not seen you yeah
18:09
so um fantastically okay yeah yeah
18:23
you can see the kind of  relationship you have again   kind of relationship are  wanting my life I really wish
18:33
from your lips to God yes amen
18:45

20:59
I just can't believe in so much anger is very upset
21:07

21:14

21:28
sister one day when will this woman eat it come  tell me when let me tell you something if Papa
21:36
I will go to the monastery oh I'm not even joking  I will be innocent sister because Ken is the only  
21:48
man for me sister he's the only one I love that  will not happen no no no you will marry King
21:58
are you sure see one day can make so much  money and papa will have no choice
22:09
this is
22:15
okay choice
22:20
it just want somebody that can  take care of things that proper  
22:26
action it tells differently because  I'm not sure it's about money alone   the everybody is to act it's as if I  don't know if I want me to get married  
22:35
you don't even understand the king I'm not  sure you just knowing it's true but then I know  
22:42
when Ken makes money you know less money so much Don't Worry Be Happy enough
22:58
okay
23:08
I need to do something and it has to be now
23:15
foreign but the question is what will I do should I run  away I I mean should can and I run from this place  
23:32
no no that is not the best thing to do  
23:38
but we can go to the city and hustle  like others so we can make money  
23:46
I think that would be Papa accepting now
23:53
but where will he go   he knows no one in the city besides his  Wicked Uncle who has refused to help him
24:05
thank you
24:24
Beauty no I'm still on the way where are you going
24:32
and I just wanted to maybe
24:41
go to wee-wee with a bug with that  bag right there you want to go and we  
24:48
will with your bag or maybe you want to  pour the wheel inside your bag isn't it so you have this fear for your father and you  had the mind to to to to run out of the home  
25:01
have you got into this eh Roti it has gotten the  days you want to run out of your family's house  
25:09
I want to run away want to leave  your parents house and run away

25:29
your life you've been behaving like someone  that has psycho are you sure you're okay is  
25:36
oh you're okay and you want to run away
25:42

25:55
making to raise you and your sister to be good  children I don't have a boy and people have been   mocking me because of it and I took a decision  that I will make you be that man I never had

47:55
with anybody who who is who is a layer about  who is not serious in in life to come here to

48:33
that if two of you have a partnered to achieve  that I'm telling you it won't work nine nine  
48:41
you realize that this same can is the only child  and the only son to a widow he lies a poor Widow  
48:49

49:51
go married to you what did you have what did you  have you heard nothing or have you forgotten so   soon those who love our daughter are meaning what  I want is any man who will come my daughter's way  
50:02
should be a man established to be hard worker  working hard so I've not recorded Ken as a  
50:10
a person who works hard so he's coming  that this man has a a polished a woman  
50:18
that he will just come and jump into I won't  allow that people must weep where they sold  
50:27
Ken should go and reap where he has sued if he  has not sowed yet let him go and start afresh
50:36
I understand how difficult it is  to you I know you can't I know it's   difficult but try for once in your  life allow Beauty to be happy please

51:37

52:45
that means so much pain is  the reason I'm in despair
52:51
it's okay it's all right my dear stop crying okay  look I'm I'm sure he said all that out of anger  
53:03
they can I know loves you so much I shouldn't  have spoken to him the way I did oh no don't say  
53:12
that look I love the way you spoke that's  division okay so please stop crying mama  
53:21
are you sure God will leave me oh no not at  all they can I know will never leave you he  
53:31
loves you so much so don't worry I'm sure he  will come around everybody hopes he will I  
53:38
hope so because Ken is my life mama I love him  so much he can't leave me I don't know if I'll  
53:45
survive but I don't know please tell me what  do I do now okay listen to what you have to do
53:57
number one is that Ken loves you so much  forget that he doesn't have money now the  
54:05
fact that he doesn't have money now does  not mean that you remain like that forever   look I've seen I've seen close that had so much  money so much when I mean so much so much money  
54:19
there was no love in their marriage and because  there was no love in their relationship there was  
54:25
no Joy of that before you say Jack that marriage  became problem rumbled and ended in bad news  
54:36
telling you really feel one thing love is the  most important thing in every relationship love  
54:48
see what's love him every other thing we made easy then  money cannot be taken away from any relationship  
55:00
especially in marriage because when a man says he  loves you he needs money to grease that love yes  
55:08
he needs money to take care of you he needs money  to make you happy he needs money to make your face  
55:14
shining if money to make you beautiful all right  thank you thank you so much you give me serious  
55:23
